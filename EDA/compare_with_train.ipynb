      "This essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state's nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state's candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly believe that the Electoral College should remain the way it is or, better yet, that we should elect the president by popular vote. This is due to the fact that the Electoral College does not accurately reflect the will of the people. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, an estimated two million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump however, Trump won the Electoral College vote, 304 to 232. This means that a candidate can win a majority of the Electoral College voters while losing the popular vote! Furthermore, voting for President should be an individual citizen decision, not a state decision. The Electoral College works by awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the winner of the majority of votes in the state. This means that a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not receive any of that states electoral votes. This goes against the concept of onepersononevote, since a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not win any electoral votes. By eliminating the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote, the votes of every individual will be counted, and the candidate who wins the most votes nationally will win the election. In conclusion, the Electoral College does not reflect the will of the people and votes in state are not equally weighted. It is time to elect the president by popular vote and to finally give the votes of individual citizens the weight they deserve.\n",

      "Limiting car use causes pollution, increases costs to users regardless of where services or services are offered. Furthermore, over use of the gas results in increased environmental degradation, harming our resources while damaging our environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When consumers pay a larger amount before gasoline is refined then there are higher costs of running the engine than otherwise. There are fewer places where the gas can be purchased locally causing more problems. Car trips will usually have higher tolls which results in lost wages for the transportation worker, who goes to an unnecessary location for work and then returns home and gets to pay back his transportation back costs. The car accident rate amongst children also has increased. Car pollution can become airborne easily, contaminating children's health. Also children tend to be more careless and more often in accidents simply because of being pushed out of their cars onto the road. All of this can be done to better an already polluted Earth that is becoming increasingly damaged at a much faster rate. Limiting our vehicle use helps our citizens with a reduced budget. It also reduces pollution for local areas. Furthermore, it improves public health and makes city dwellers a wealthier society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limiting our own usage by adopting public transportation, walking, biking, and public transport actually would be beneficial for the citizens and planet. I think its very healthy but very little others show similar sentiment mostly environmental activists who want a more environmentally clean place so it often is still looked down upon it still will bring about a very drastic price eventually but there will never be carbon credit trading or an oil recycling scheme unless people want it too. Limiting car use is good for the city.\n",

The third reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because drivers pay a lot of money to get handsfree. Not be allowed to use cell phones at all is like the government robbing them twice. Twice because once for the handsfree, and another for a ticket for using it.

People should not be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Cell phones are a distraction and when being used while driving, could result in a car accident that might be fatal or in the least, cause serious injury to you or another innocent person.\n",
      "\n",
      "When driving a car, the biggest distraction is a cell phone that is turned on and ready to receive calls and text messages. Even cell phone providers are moving towards advancements with applications that assist drivers to ignore their phones or mute them until the vehicle is not operational. Some states are passing laws that require drivers to place their cell phones in an area out of reach to the driver.\n",

      "\n",
      "The driver might take their eyes off the road for a split second, and then return their eyes to the roadway and have no clue if they stopped at a stop sign or ran through a red light. When a driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text or find a phone number to make a call, the driver has just put their life and other lives into serious danger. Life as they know it can dramatically change with that one quick glance away from the road.\n",

A distracted driver can be the cause of physical harm or even death to oneself or others. Why is it such a hard thing to put your phone down while driving? I am glad the state of Georgia passed the \"Hands Free\" or \"Distracted Driver\" law that states no cell phones should be touched by the driver of a vehicle. Too many people die every year because of distracted drivers that were either texting or talking while driving a vehicle. A loss of life is the most horrific experience any family member will deal with and most definitely the most senseless reason for a family to lose a loved one. Picture your parents answering the door to a police officer and the officer telling them you have been involved in a car wreck... it's the absolute worst nightmare for any parent.

      "Nowadays people use their phones for just about any and everything. Things such as texting, calling, playing games, booking appointments, even checking latest posts on social media and much more. Cell phones started to become a problem when people were just looking down at their phones while crossing the street. Something that could be fixed. Now, people are choosing to use their phones while driving which has become an issue and is very dangerous. Which puts not only the driver in danger put others as well.\n",

      "Each day people are dying or being injured from using their cellular devices while being behind the wheel. Each year 421,000 people in the United States are injured due to a driver being distracted by their device. It's more common for teens and young adults to text and drive (ages 18-24). 14% of fatal crashes are involved from texting and driving in this age division.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017 the \"Hands Free Law\" had been issued. Which means drivers are allowed to use hand free devices only while being behind the wheel of a car and being completely free of a device. Although people may think the hands free law has prevented less accident it hasn't it only makes people have the urge to reach for their devices even more. 11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway.\n",

I feel as if you need to use your device while behind the wheel of a moving vehicle be mindful and pull to the side. Weather it's for making a quick call or sending a quick message even typing in a location into the GPS pull over because anything could happen in the blink of an eye.\n",

Even though cell phones are useful in so many ways, people use them while driving and that is dangerous for the driver and for the passengers in the car, if there are any, but also for the pedestrians outside on the street and fro other drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drivers that text and drive or just look at their phone in general while operating their vehicle make it dangerous for other drivers and pedestrians. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is unsafe and you can hurt not just yourself but other people as well. So many deaths have occurred because people have texted while driving a vehicle and they hurt people or even cause a death because they were paying attention to their phone instead of paying attention to the road. As a matter of fact, teens are the age group that looks at their phone while driving, not all teens do, because they grew up with technology and they take their phone wherever they go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teens today are distracted by their phones because they want to see what their friends are doing or what a certain celebrity is doing and it is safe if they are doing that at home but if they are looking at their phone weather it is looking at social media or texting a friend while driving that is unsafe for everyone around them. Teens should not be able to use their phones while driving or even operate a vehicle if they know they are going to look at their phone at some point. Some teens will tell you that they know how to drive while using their phone at the same time or they would probably even tell you that they have been looking at their phone while driving for so long that they have not been in an accident, but even if that is the case those teens should not be able to drive because as stated so many times now, it is unsafe to text/ look at your phone while operating a vehicle because it is unsafe. On the other hand, you may look at your phone to help you out instead of letting your phone distract you while driving a vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "One exception, even though it is still dangerous, that you can look at your phone for not too long is if you are using your GPS to help you get to your destination. On everyone's phone there is a GPS app and a lot of people use that to their advantage to help them get to where they want to be if they have never been there before or even the opposite if they are somewhere that they have never been before they can use their GPS to help them guide them back home. Furthermore, using your GPS while driving is still dangerous because you are taking your eyes off of the road, even if it is only for a few seconds, it is still dangerous even though your using your GPS to help you out to get to your destination. Ultimately, using your phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous even if you are using your GPS to your benefit to help you out, it is still dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, texting while driving or just looking at your phone in general is dangerous for not only you and the passengers in car but also for the people outside of the car and for the other drivers. Phones are useful for so many things like downloading games or watching videos but drivers should not be able to use that phone in any capacity. So many deaths have occurred because people have looked at their phone while driving but the age group that uses their phone and look at their phone while driving are teens because they want to text a friend or check on their social media; one exception, even though it is still dangerous, is using the GPS on your phone to help you get to your destination. To summarize, drivers should not be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle.\n",

So many lives are taken or altered because of the simple decision to send or reply to one text message. If precautions are heavily enforced before adults and teens especially enter the car, then maybe this epidemic can become obsolete. Fines are enforced but how well is the question? Phones are the biggest distraction when you enter a car by far so this doesn't completely forget about alcohol or trying to change the radio station but technology has become so advanced that we have voice text and on a star. If the message is that important phones should become voice-activated and only respond to your voice so we can still pay attention to the road and send out a text without removing our hands from the wheel. Technology has also clutched us with Bluetooth if you need to stay in communication just use Bluetooth and make a phone call instead which is completely easier than sending a text anyway because its faster and you can get responses much quicker than you could with a text message.

Many cities and countries are taking part in this attempt to clear the air, such as: Germany, Paris, Columbia, and the United States.

If one wishes to own a car, they must purchase a car space with their home, costing a whopping $40,000.(source:1;paragraph:2) This automatically discourages home-owners to purchase a car because of the steep price. The attempt to rid the air of pollution is gradually becoming more and more successful. 70 percent of Vauban families do not own any motor vehicles, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to the small town. The United States Environmental Protection Agency approves of this movement and is promoting car reduced communities.

The same rule would apply to any motorists with odd-numbered plates the next day. Evidently, it did not seem as if the people cared about the wellness of their planet, since 4,000 drivers were fined in a single day. 27 people were so furious with this law, their reactions cause them all to have their cars impounded.(source:2;paragraph:10-12) The pollution was catastrophic enough to have Paris challenging China for the record of the most polluted city in the world.

Today my sister and I created a mess of emissions just getting to school to take this test that is completely worthless. I do not gain from this test, nor do my proctors who have to dilligently coach a hundrded students through a bogus set of instructions for this bogus test. Those emmissions are still rising. For each one person in the room where i'm taking this worthless test, hundreds of cubic feet in carbon monoxide gas have been released into the atmosphere. When this test is over it will be sent to some place, probably in the northern part of Florida for a bunch of people to grade. Test by test.

We have no idea who created this test, why we're taking it, or even the slightest insight of who's grading it or if it will even be graded! We're like a bunch of helpless test animals deprived of sleep because we have to write some bogus test. I look around me in this room and there is at least 40 people who I can see are pouring their hearts out on this test. I did yesterday, and for what? I cant be proud about this essay I just wrote, or even share it with my family, there is hardly even a record I took this darn thing. They tell us that we're setting the bar high for other schools but for what reason. Why would you strive to be better than someone who has writen their sole out on this essay. Its supposed to be special with origionality! These are supposed grades that you ace because you wrote a beautiful essay you cherished, and took pride in and even brought in other authors to make your work stronger, then you hear that that essay you submitted was to set the bar high for people we've never met. What kind of sick mind creates prompts for sudents to devote themselves to school and greatness and makes them take this whole thing just to see how it went? Why dont you make this thing worth a goal? Give us an incentive! It's so rediculous that I have to sit here and write about car emissions when I dont drive. You should turn this around on yourslef and ask why you did it. Why the hell do you need to test us on the daily basis like this. This test is an outrage and a discrase that should not even be thought about. I have better stuff to do.

I feel sorry that my school and I have to put up with this crap. This test was a giant waste of time, you dont deserve my response and screw you for putting me and 500 other people through this. Before you even try to do this again ask yourself if what you're doing is right, if it's worth other peoples while. I want someone who made this test happen to read my little rant to see how students really feel. I know I speak for many of my peers with this writting. If you're just reading this and have nothing to do with me receiving this test, no hard feelings. Have a great day and thanks for taking your valuable time to read this.

This is also a small preview into the curriculum of the class and it also can allow a student to have an outlook on their teacher's style and format of teaching.

Over the summer, before I was taking an advanced placement course, I was required to complete a packet reviewing the material that was needed to understand what was going to be educated in the class. If I had not finished this packet, I would have been completely lost during the economics seminar we had to participate in during the first week of the course.

Teacher-designed summer projects are often times needed because there is not always time for a professor to teach the given curriculum in a school year. But, summer assignments are not always beneficial. Some students benefit off of vocal learning much more than visual. If the professor of a class were to just take about two to three classes just to explain the material that would otherwise be gone over whilst completing a summer assignment, then surely students would get a better understanding of the material at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "If students were given the opportunity to design their own summer project, it would allow for each student to have the freedom of learning what most interests them about the course.This freedom can be a blessing and a curse, because it is inevitable that many would look at this as an opportunity to complete the least amount of work possible. This year, SCHOOL_NAME is trying to limit teachers from giving at home assessments that are worth a grade point percentage. This resulted in the majority of homework assignments being non-graded. Many students are looking at this as a way to get out of doing work, but this will always come back to hurt them in the future. A student who completes all of the work assigned, regardless of if it is graded or not, has a much higher chance of doing well in the class compared to a student who only does the required amount of work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall reasoning for summer assignments is for students to keep their head in a \"school mindset\". With them being teacher-designed, it allows each and every student the chance to learn the basis of the subject that they are about to be taught. Student-designed summer projects will always end up with students completing the minimum amount of work possible. Each student deserves a chance to get a jump start into the curriculum and by having this \"jump-start\" it allows for students to get the most out of a class.\n",

      "Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Teacher should not assign project during summer break because students will forget and will become stressed out, students may have other summer actives such as Generic_School sports or camps, and all in all students just need a break away from learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, students should not be assigned summer project because students will forget and will become stressed out. We as students assume a lot from our teacher throughout that 11 months we are in school, we do not need a summer project during our three months of summer vacation. For example, my friend Generic_Name, had to read two books and write a six page essay about each books, Generic_Name was so stressed due to the fact she forgot about the papers till the last month. Generic_Name had taken several vacation that summer with her family and never really had any down time to read and write a paper on the stories. This is a prime example of why students should not have summer project assigned to them. Another example of how summer projects could be stressful is, my brother Generic_Name. Generic_Name had to write a play for English and didnt get reminded about it till the day before school was back in. Generic_Name stressed himself out to the point where he had to go to the ER because it was so my stress of trying to get his summer assignment done on time. Summer project can be very stressful on many students and also many students may forget about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, students should not be assigned summer project because they may have other summer actives planned. For example, my friend Generic_Name, had a lot of actives and things should wanted to do over the summer such as, getting a job, playing sports, and taking trips. Generic_Name could not fit all that and school work in her plans. Generic_Name of course did not want to start off the school year with a bad grade but she also had some personal things she wanted to achieve that summer. PROPER_NAME made some adjustments to her summer plan so that she could get the work done but had to miss out on getting a job this summer. We as students all have things to do just like adults. For instant, my mom as a child was the oldest sister and had to always watch her younger siblings when her mom was at work. \"Watching younger kids may be difficult sometimes,\" she said even with the very little down time she had she wanted to go out with friends and play basketball. The school work that was assigned to her took away her time of doing what she loved when she was not watching her siblings. Summer assignment take over kids summer that why we should not be assigned them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, students should not be assigned summer project because they need a break from learning all in all. We as students are always told, \" you learn something new each and everyday.\" Learning take place in our everyday life. For instant, students with jobs learn how to do mental math when customers purchase something. Learning does not just come from our teachers, we are taught by just the people we are around during our summer break. Summer break should be our time to have fun and do what we want, not having to deal with a school project. Another example students just need a break from learning is that we are in school for a 11 months, we assume a lot of great information from our teachers throughout that time period. We as students should not have to have a assignment to keep us learning, we learn from each other and many other people in this world. These are some of the reasons students do not need assignments over summer break.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Students do not need projects over summer break because students will forget and will become stressed out, students may have other summer actives planned, and all in all students just need a break from learning.I personal feel like students learn enough in the 11 month that they are in school. Summer projects is just something that getting in the way of students having fun and letting loose once in a while.Summer break should be our one time to forget about school for 3 months, lets keep it that way!\n",

      "The Adventures of a Seagoing Cowboy\n",
      "\n",
      "Written By: PROPER_NAME\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whoosh Splat\" those are the sounds of waves crashing against my cattle boat. These are also sounds heard by my crew and I \"Seagoing Cowboys.\" We are people who are hired to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. You should look for an opportunity to sign up to be in the Seagoing Cowboy's program because you can go sightseeing, you get the satisfaction of helping others, and you can play games to pass time.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, we can play fun games onborad and just relax. While some of you might say, that we can play games anywhere anytime. Yes, that may be true but playing games on a boat is probably someting not many people have done. For example, We found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We can do these things to pass time when you think things are super boring. Also, you just get a time to enjoy being on a boat wih your crew and relax so you can just have fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, you get the satisfaction of helping others. People might say they could just do it themselves. They could but the main part of being a Seagoing Cowboy mainly consists of helping people in need. We get to help countries for a good cause. For example, we get to help people recover food and feed a hungry family. The best part about this job is, you get to take care of animals and keep them safe while the family can get set up once again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, we get to go sightseeing. Some might say, you could just buy a plane ticket and go wherever you want. While that may be true, we don't have to pay to get here. For example, \"Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,\" I said. You can stop and see countries you'd never imagine going to. You can stop and see famous landmarks that you've dreamed of visiting. The possibilities are endless!\n",
      "\n",
      "In Conclusin, You should look for an opportunuty to sign up be in the Seagoing Cowboy's program because you can go sightseeing, you get the satisfaction of helping others, and you can play games to pass the time. My job as a seagoing cowboy is to give families hope and let them be joyous because of you. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. it opened up the world to me. I'm grateful for the opportunity,\"i said,\"It made me more aware of people and other counries and their needs.\" And that awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. Go sign up now to be a seagoing cowboy!\n",

      "Hi, I am PROPER_NAME and I really recomend that you join the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program can be hard work at some time,so be ready for that. There are also many benifits to this trip. I myself had a very exciting and memerable journey, and if you decide to join you will have one too.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see tons of new places. I got to see places like Europe and China. I also met and created a bond with new people, While I was there I saw new cultures. This program allowed me to be aware of other countries and there needs by not hearing about them, but actually witnessing it. I also had some fun on board with the other members of the Seagoing Cowboys club. We played games like fencing, boxing, and even table tennis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now if I told you that the Seagoing Cowboys program was all fun and games, I would be lying. There is a lot of work to do. One time I fell down a slippery ladder. I didn't die,(because if I did I couldn't have wrote this.)but I did get hurt badly and I cracked my ribs. There are many responsibilities while on board. I had to work with animals. I had to load and unload them off the ship. Also on my second trip I was the night watchman, and my job was to check on the animals every hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though there is is work to be done the Seagoing Cowboys program was a great opritunity for me, and it could also be a great opritunity for you.Helping out at my aunt PROPER_NAME's farm prepared me, and maybe you have some preperation too.This trip taught me more than i could have ever learned at home.The Seagoing Cowboys program really opened my eyes.I hope I go again,and I hope I see you there.\n",

      "================================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine this: Rolling around in a field with your great friends, some you don't know, but some you want to meet. Having fun, laughing, enjoying life. Some people don't get to enjoy that experience. Some students don't want to push themselves for something they want to strive for. I think that it is important that students give extracurricular activities a try. People can meet new people, students could have a really fun time, and it can be a great way to find a new activity that you are really good at and like. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I think that it can be a fun and exciting experience for students. For example, Bill Smith from the Virginia Board of Education implies, \"Lots of children don't love school, so I believe that if there is anyway to make it a little more exciting and have fun activities, then kids would like it better.\" I think that is a good point, lots of kids and including me don't love school so it would be cool if we had to do an activity because maybe that is something students would look forward to after a long day of school. Being in an extracurricular activity can be a great opportunity to have fun and not worry about school, which I think is important. That does depend on what activity you are doing. You want to be doing one that you love, because if you werent then it would not be a happy experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, extracurricular activities can be a great way for you to find out what you like and who you are as a person. For example, Sally Sue, secretary of the Bayview High Middle School say that, \"Finding out who you are and your strengths is a very important thing for this world and who you want to become.\" That is a very good thought, I think that who you are is an important thing for you to figure out. Even from just doing a silly extracurricular activity you can find out what you are good at and what you can accomplish for life up ahead. I know a friend who is doing a yearbook and photography club, and maybe that is her way of finding out if she wants to do photography when she is older or not. It is a great way to find out if you want to do it in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I believe that participating in different activities you can find new friends and meet people who you don't usually talk to. One thing PROPER_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME suggest, \"Lot of kids are in different programs here, but not a lot of the kids know each other. We purposely put kids in different groups to learn about each other.\" That is a cool idea. I feel that at our school not everybody knows each other, having those actives, I believe could solve that. For example, I was in this club at my school and I had no friends in it and I didn't really like it because of that. Then I started talking to people and I started to become really good friends with some people that I am still friends with to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people believe that students may be to busy for these activities. Editor Jerry Ram from the Michigan Company says that \"Students and teachers are busy a lot of the times, kids have homework and other things going on in their lives.\" On the other hand, the activity does not have to be very long nor everyday and it could even be during school at the end of the day. For example, Timmy Lung from the Board of Supervisors argues \"When people thing about activities they think after school, but that is not the case. Activities can be during any time of the school day.\" I agree with that, when we do Clubs at BRMS we do them at the end of the day. That way kids can go home and go and do homework and have time for their other sport. I know that if we had extracurricular activities after school then it would be hard for me because I have other sports to do and lots of homework on top of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum up, students should all try at least one extracurricular activity. Doing this, It can give kids a try on what they may want to do when they grow up and for the future, it also could be a very fun and exciting experience for the students, and lastly students could meet and talk to new students that they don't typically talk to. For this to happen you need to take action so you should go and write a letter to your principle saying and expressing what you think. Also if you are already doing an extracurricular activity then speak up to people you don't really talk to and be open minded to anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All students must complete at least one extracurricular activity this year.\" Principal PROPER_NAME said over the intercom. PROPER_NAME said to himself,\"What is an extracurricular activity?\" He was lonely and all he did was munch on food after school. He needed an activity to do after school because he was always full of boredom. PROPER_NAME trudged up to the school club board to choose a club. Something caught his eye that he had never thought of trying, he could become a wrestler and have his own sport that he could be good at instead of eating. He started the sport and loved it then two years later he became the reigning state champ in his heavyweight class. Students in schools should participate in at least one extracurricular activity each year because it helps them find what they can be good at, it helps some kids make new friends, and sports that they provide for you can help you stay fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, the main reason that it is good to do an extracurricular activity after school is that a student can find out what they could become good at if they tried and their talents that they have. For example, it should be required for students to do a sport so that maybe the school team could use some more talent or need one extra person to step up so that the team can play competitively against other schools. It would make the team better and more talented because it would be harder to make for some kids. If a kid does not make the team they can learn from it and try something different. Some kids need a sport so that if they are like PROPER_NAME they can find what they can become good at good at.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, some kids don't have friends or could use some more friends. The students with little friends can do an extracurricular activity and become new friends with the kids that need friends. Extracurricular activities can help some students become more social so that they are not be quiet all the time. Parents of some kids work very late nights and they would have nobody watching their kids after school, this would be an advantage to having extracurricular activities as well. Some parents of kids cannot afford for their kid to do a sport but the good thing about extracurricular clubs and sports is that they are free and the parents would not have to buy anything for their kid to play a sport or be in a club. There are many varieties of clubs to choose from and all a kid has to do is find the club that would fit for them just right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, some students that are not in shape and need to become physically fit. Sports can help you want to stay in shape and not just eat and eat all the time they can gain habits of eating healthier so that when they eat and eat they can make sur they are eating healthy. If you do track you run a lot at practices and if you do basketball you run up and down the court a lot this can all help you lose weight if you are out of shape. Being physically fit can prevent yourself from getting diabetes later in life, and it can also give you many advantages in life. Additionally, if you want to run a marathon when you get older and that is a personal goal for yourself, you won't be able to run a marathon if you are fat and out of shape. Being able to achieve some of your physical goals doesn't happen over night so this is why you should have to be forced to sign up for these extracurricular activities like a sport to achieve some of your goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, everyone in schools should be required to do an extracurricular activity and find what they like and what talents they have through what extracurricular activities are offered at your school.\"I finally found what I am good at and I am not fat anymore!\" PROPER_NAME  said.\" Thank you Principal Warner for making me do an extracurricular activity, now I know what I am good at and the talent I have!\" Some extracurricular activities would look good on your resume for a job and would help you become successful in life. Doing something other than school is not a bad thing it will only help you and could with school as well. Students in schools should participate in at least one extracurricular activity each year because it helps them find what they can be good at, it helps some kids make new friends, and sports that they provide for you can help you stay fit.\n",

      "Imagine that your sitting in your eighth period science classroom learning about what electrons and dry cells are. Then the bell starts ringing indicating that the tiring school day has finally come to an end. You quickly pack up your stuff, excited to go home after a very long and stressful day of hard work, tests, projects, and essays. You are so excited to go home that you almost forget about your mandatory yearbook club meeting that you have after school today. Extracurricular activities are activities such as sports, clubs, or student councils that are not part of the seven hours in your school day. Drama club, Art club, your schools football team, and basketball team are all great examples of some of the extracurricular activities that your school may offer for their students. Students should not have to do any mandatory extracurricular activities, because it takes away from some of their homework time, they may have responsibilities after school, and some students just might not enjoy any of the extracurricular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, doing an extracurricular activity takes away from a students' already short amount of time they get for their homework. Almost every one of our teachers assigns about one hour of homework for each of our classes everyday, expecting everything to be completed, perfect, and correct that very next day, adding on an extracurricular activity would just make life that much harder and stressful on students. There have been times when I would be doing homework for five hours straight with no breaks, and hardly getting everything finished on time, and I didn't even have any of these extracurricular activities to do after school. These hour long activities would tire out students even more then a normal school day would, and cause them to want to go to sleep when they get home, and this could lead them to forget about their homework or not having enough time to get it done. If some students already don't do their homework imagine how many wouldn't do it because of these activities taking up time in their day. Homework is about ten percent of our grade in almost all of our classes and not doing it can make our grades drop drastically and quickly. One of my friends, PROPER_NAME, had to stop playing softball for a three seasons, because her grades were suffering and she didn't have enough time to get all of her work done. With sports in particular you could be having up to four hours of practice after school everyday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, lots of students could have responsibilities after school. Lots of kids chores they have to do when they get home like taking out the trash, helping make dinner, and doing the laundry. Also some students may have younger siblings that they need to take care of because their parents work late at night. My dad is a doctor and has to work long hours, he doesn't get home until late at night, around seven or eight, and my mom gets home around four or five in the afternoon, so my older sister, Generic_Name, has to pick our eight year old brother, Generic_Name, up from his school almost everyday. Some other students might have jobs they have to do after school to earn some extra money. They could be using that money to help out their families, because they might not be in a very good or stable financial state. The schools don't know if their students have personal problems at home with money or not. They also might be saving money for their future or collage tuition ,so they don't have to get a loan and go in to debt. Having an extracurricular activity would get in the way of all of this. This could cause students to struggle with balancing school, extracurricular activities, homework, and their jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, students just might not enjoy any of the extracurricular activities. They may not find any activity that they like or that sparks their interest. If students are forced to do an activity they don't like they are going to loath their days even more then normal. They might also feel nerves or awkward if they don't know anyone in their extracurricular activity, causing them to not want to talk to anybody. Like when I went to my gym class the first day of school, it was the only class I didn't know anybody in. I hated it for the first month until a couple of my friends transferred into the class. Also some students might not like staying after school and would prefer to go home and relax for a little. I only stay after school when I have to because I missed a big test, but any other day I would just walk home with my friends and relax a little before starting my homework.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclution, I believe that having any sort of mandatory extracurricular activity after school would not benefit the students there for it would not be the best nor the smartest idea to have them. Homework, after school responsibilities, and enjoyment should take a large roll in the decision making, and I don't believe that extracurricular activities is what is best for the students and their education. I say that we should stick with extracurricular activities being optional and letting whom ever wants to do these activities do them, but at their own free will. Now, imagine that back in your science classroom at the end of the day. The last bell ringing indicating the tiring school day is now finally over. Your getting ready to go home after the long day of hard work, tests, projects, and essays to relax.\n",

      "\n",
      "Our principle has recently stated to all the students of SCHOOL_NAME that all students have to participate in one extracurricular activity. Some students agree with this new idea and some do not. I agree with our principle that it should be mandatory to take at least one extracurricular activity. There are many activities to chose from but in my opinion, the best activities are doing the school musical, participating in a sport, and helping teachers during your spare time. Here is my reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musical is a great extracurricular activity for students to participate in. Participating in musical gives students a chance to make friends and to get to know others. When I first moved here I did not have many friends or kids to hang out with but when I joined musical I began to meet so many people and they are considered to be my friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Musical allows students to get to know others and to make friends. During your time in musical you have to memorize so many things like songs, lines, and dances. When you memorize these things it allows me to memorize things in school much better. I can memorize how to perform a math equation as well as learning a song. Musical allows students to memorize things better in school just like in musical. Finally musical also gives you a great sense of confidence. When you perform a scene in front of a audience you need confidence and when practice the scene enough you get confident about it and you perform it perfectly. You can use that kind of confidence when you are taking a test/quiz cause if you studied it enough you get the confidence to do well on it. Musical can teach you how confidence works and how to gain it. Musical is a great extracurricular activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great extracurricular activity are sports! One of the main perks of playing sports is that they keep you in shape and keep you physically active. In our world today we see teens with there heads down looking at there phones but when you are playing a sport you become way more physically active. Sports allow students to be more proactive. Along with the fact of being physically active sports also allow students to think quick on there feet. When you play sports your has to think quickly which allows the brain to think faster. When I play baseball I have to think of the play quickly because if I do not think about it what will I do if the ball comes to me. So when you play sports your mind begins to think quicker which can be very helpful in school. If you need to think of a homework plan or if you need to think on if you have quizzes or tests that week use your quick thinking. Finally sports can also teach you on how to be a great leader. When you are playing a game of baseball and you are the captain and you are leading the team; you learn on what is the best play or who should go where. So sports allow you to learn how to be a good leader and with all this reasoning sports are another good extracurricular activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally another good extracurricular activity is being a TA(teachers assistant). Being a TA allows students to assist others in need. When I was a TA for Spanish I got help kids who were struggling on a worksheet or who did not word meant. Being a TA allows students to assist others who need help. Along with helping others you also get to learn what being a teacher is like and what the perks of it are. When I was a TA I learned how my teacher taught the class and what she did with students who were not doing what they were suppost to. Being a TA allows students to learn what being a teacher is like. Finally when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others and it is a good extracurricular activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stated in the beginning that I agree with our principle that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity. I said that due to the fact that extracurricular activitys are fun and there are many benefits. My top three activities were musical, sports, and being a TA(teachers assitant). I say that every single student in SCHOOL_NAME should do an extracurricular activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All students should participate in activities at school to keep themselves happy and to prepare themselves for their future lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, students should participate in activities because they will learn to be more responsible. Students will learn to bring the material they need in order to participate in the activity they are in. Furthermore, responsibility will help them a lot in life and it would make their lives easier, because if people are not responsible they end up being losing their homes, lose their money, and then they would have to live in the streets and start begging for other people to help them. People should learn responsibility to prepare themselves for any trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, Students will learn skills they have never learned before such as, Cooking, Painting, Drawing, etc. Some students when they grow up they would want to take the skills they learned from their childhood and earn money from them. Some students become famous artists or famous chef because they learned those skills from their school days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, Students will learn to be mature faster. For example, some students are there because they want to take the job in the near future, so they will have to take in seriously and they will not have time to play around, they will be focused on learning the skills more then playing around all the time. Some people might agree with this, and some might not, some people think that a lot of kids are only there for the fun of the class and they dont take the class seriously, but kids are kids some times they will be playing around and some times they would be serious about the class. Some kids might want the job in the future and some are only there for the fun of the fun of the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, students will make even more friends when participating in an activity at school. For example, PROPER_NAME doesn't have any friends, so he decides to join a club or activity he likes and there he starts telling people what he loves and why he joined that club or activity and in a few days when he keeps talking to the other kids they become friends right away simple as that. Making friends in a club or an activity is that that hard all you have to do is tell people what you love and what you don't love and some people might have the same things that you love and they might become your friends right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, students will enjoy doing what they love to do. One reason why kids don't participate in activities is because the activities dont have things that the kids like. It is important to let kids do what they love unless it is a good thing, dont always stop your kids from doing what they love, this might affect their life, some kids dont get a job when they grow up and start living in the streets and selling illegal stuff, so it is important to let kids do what they want to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Kids should participate in activities they love in order to keep to help themselves in their future lives and keep themselves happy and keep themselves away from trouble and protect their future families.\n",

Due to things like they may not have time, there to busy playing on there games station at home or maybe just to lazy to even try. joining an active that you like can be fun and challenging to do. i'm PROPER_NAME and I wanted to talk about if students should participate in extracurricular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "participating in extracurricular activities can be a great way to help students get engaged with something they love doing. playing sports or serving on student council can be mentally and pshicaly healthy. If a child were to play a sport it could help with there health because there being more active. For example soccer is a great sport for someone who loves to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working on the yearbook or serving on the student council can challenge the brain as in learning how to solve problems and or taking on leadership. participating in activities can be good for students social lives. instead of laying on their bed watching TV all day they could be hanging out with some friends after soccer practice. Now saying that this does not mean to put your kids into a sport or active that they do not want to be a part of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lets say you did put or child in a active that they didnt like that much. it wouldnt be as fun as it should be. your child may end up upset and quit.Do ing an extra sport or playing chess can be a great thing for children. in conclusion students should participate in extracurricular activates.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well Venus is sometimes called a Evening Star. It's so bright that young stargazer would be able to find it. Venus is very hard to get a good look at, it's the second planet from the sun. It's name can be misleading, and the planet is refrred to earth as our \" twin\" plaents. We haven't been able to send a spacecraft over there yet because of the fact that the stuff we send over there are not able to survive for less than an hour. Scientist's have onle been able to send robots and teven they can't find a safe landing sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clouds on Venus very corrosive since they have sulfruic acid in them. The air is also 97 percent carbon dioxide. The planet also has the hostest surface, it's tempurature can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric preasure is also 90 times greater than Earth's, but despite the planets dangers it would be a worthy pursuite. For example the planets atmospheric preasure is so strong that it crush a submarine that can go into the deepest part of the ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientist's are fascinated by the planets Earth-like apperence. They think that long ago there use be a form of life that could have been very much Earth-like. The main reasonfor why astronomer's are so fascinated by Venus is because it looks very much like Earth. For example it has valleies, river bank's, and even mountains. Scientist's are thinking of sending a blimp like aircraft that can fly or hover at least 30 if not higher miles the planet's surface. The tempurature would range around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The best part would be that there is plenty is solar power.\n",

      "\n",
      "The author talks how the idea of people can adpat to the conditions of Venus and settle there like our home planet Earth. There are some problems that he think are challenges. The planet is 90 times the amount of pressure we have on Earth. Most of the air is carbon dioxide blankets that covers 97 percent of the planet's thick atmosphere. The temperature is around about to 800 degrees on the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Venus that has the hottest surface temperature that would melt anything on contact including people. Also, it would crush you or anything else like a piece of paper. There is also bad weathering that cause problems. Like for example: erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the postive side, we can make a vehicle that will let us float above the fray. Use solar energy to power the vehicle to float. We can avoid the unfriendly conditions on the ground.

      "I think this claim would be very usefull in a students environment. The resone I feel as why this facial action coding system would do well in schools is because. The student mind is very fragial and kids might be sad from being bullied and might not express how they feel. With this type of technaloge school can lower the risks of suicides or school shooting by trying to help the child in any way they can. And also can stop kids that bully eachother or can even provent harmful perents at the childs home. It is sad to hear that one of your fello class mates has just commeted suicide.

      "\n",
      "Alright so why should student's should be allowed to have technology.Okay so there is many reasons why i think we should have alittle of technology in our time as right now.But most importantly the resources that we will be able to use for information.To find good article facts about a pacfific topic on a good reseach.Why dose 95 % of the world use technology for because of social media if social media wasn't even alive right now there would be no more usage of the devices that the world have as our time today.But most people don't realize that not having technology now days could have impacted Amercian's too be more worried about there love ones.Althought people could just use not alot of the usage of phones and laptop's and computers etc. This time of age little kids even use more technology than adults do just because of the games have been made on the devices.The reason why people use much technology cause now days there are more outbreaks on social media like how billy Graham died they sent a whole tweet about it the news got big on social media. I can see why half of the reaons why people use technology much as for there work and jobs they have to look up research about stuff ordering different types of things so they can have the right enought things that they wanted to get on a website.But most people don't realize you can just do that and also not use as much technology most kid's don't even interact with one another they always text there friends on a apps like snapchat ,instagram facebook and including messager on apple phones and samsung phone's .They just text there friend's and say you want hang out at my house but they don't realize half of Amercians don't get there home work done in school just because of the technology we have now day's half of school in my class be on there phone 24/7 they don't even pay any attention to most of the teachers that trying to benefit them to have a nice good decent edcuation and including how they listen to music while a teacher trying to get there attention to answer a question that we a learning in class so i think people should not be allowed to have technoloy in school or out of school.\n",

      "I personally, think that it would be a bad idea to use this kind of technology in shools to help students learn. This is mainly because of errors that the computer could make, or other outside factors. If the program makes changes to the lesson due to facial expressions alone, then it would make an unbelievable amount of mistakes. In case you still aren't sure what im getting at ill explain in more detail below.\n",
      "\n",
      "First lets just ignore the outside factors and I'll talk about just the flaws of it telling emotions based completely off of facial expressions. Im sure that I am not alone in saying that no matter how I'm being taught I will, without a doubt, be bored. If It detects this then it will try to switch to a way of teaching that it thinks that I will enjoy. The problem, however, comes when I'm bored with that way as well. Because it would keep switching, it would be almost impossible to learn anything due to the program changing how the lesson is tought every five minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now lets ignore the problems with the facial recognition not working properly, and focus on the outside factors that would make putting this in our schools a disaster. Lets say that you hate a the way it is currently teaching the lesson. Then out of nowhere you see PROPER_NAME over in the corner fall out of his chair and smile, meanwhile your computer is sitting there thinking, \"Oh boy, the human really likes it when I teach this way!\" and decides to teach like that more often. Well now that kid is stuck learning that way until the program can take a hint and change it. Now lets explore the opposite effect. Lets say that the program has been doing an amazing job teaching you, but your cat died yesterday so you are verry sad. The Program now thinks that it is doing a bad job teaching you and decides to cross that method of teaching off of the list and try another one. Now you aren't learning as well as you could be otherwise.\n",

      "Hello readers my name is PROPER_NAME and, today I'm gonna dicuss the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman that enables computers to indentify human emotions. Also I'm gonna support this claim about the new human emotions technology,and I'm gonna use details from the story to back up this claim so you readers know \"this new\" technology is legit. So now let's get to it shall we you readers out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Renaissance painting by artist Leonardo da Vinci called Mona Lisa was studied by a scientist named Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who innovated some new computer software that can recognize human emtions, working alongside with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr Huang and his colleague were developing a better way for humans and humans to communicate with each other.I agree with this claim, you wanna why? Because technlogy in general has come a long way, and the fact it's taken to the next step is phenomenal. Like it might be a chance that a computer software can determine how we feel and not just humans in genreal, but even old paintings so long ago isn't that incredible. But in part of the story i feel like tihs software could actually work out was that it said that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one oe more muscles is an \"action unit.\" which means that they need to scan the face of a human like features in order to scan the face. When works on thigns like this he normally relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, he is the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Edwin has classified six emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the muscles. For instance when you raise your eyebrows you're surprised, but when you raise your eyebrows down by your mouth you're angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another good reason why i think this technology is really good and it can help is.That when facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Use videp imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements- from a real face such as Mona Lisa. If u weigh the different units' the software can even identify mixed emotions. So cool that just shows you how advanced technology can be. Also each expression is cmpared against a neutral face.\n",
      "\n",
      "My final defense to back this claim up is that computers got so advanced over the years it's kinda like it knows who to set up your mood of what you wanna see. For instance, if you smile when a Web ad appears on oyur screen, a smilar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different. Hell a classroom computer could even detect when a student is becoming confused or bored. Well in that case it could vhelp modify lesson for the student to make them become more intertested in the assignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well thank you readers i feel like i backed up my case with tih claim, we know computers or even technology in general might've changed in a jurrasic way but we will wonder what the future has in stored for us. We just gotta find out what's next in technology. My name is PROPER_NAME and this is my claim for FACS.\n",

But can help more in the classromms because it would help the teachers to now how their students are fealling and if they are having problems in the class or in theyr personal lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Facial Action Coding System worcks by associating characteristic movements of the facial muscles witch emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology can help the teachers \"reconize when a student is becoming confuse or bored\"(Dr. Huang). So the teacher can find a way to help their students, by founding another way to make them comprehend the class better or talk about their problems and find a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion having this tipe of technololy in our schools can be realy help full and make a big change on the way students see the chools and in how the students learn. Beacuse by using this technology the teachers can find ways to make theyr clases more interesting or find diferent options so the students cant learn more, and they also can help to identify students that have problems or that have tipes of sadness or anger so the teachers can help them find a solution to theyr problems.\n",

What about if somebody is sad but they just don't want to talk about it. Somebody might bring it up in class saying \"PROPER_NAME is sad\" or \"What's wrong with PROPER_NAME\" I would not want to have a teacher ask me what's wrong in front of all of my classmates. I can see it if people might want to use it to see if the students are bored with their class work but other than that I would not like it at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, when the author says \"The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face. while it shows just how much the computer can do.\" i don't agree with that at all it should be your right to say that you don't want to have people ask if you are okay. This new computer would not make me smile it would make me angry. I think that they should only do it on paintings and not on real life people. I also think if they do this new computer thing a lot of people would be angry,\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, i do not like the idea of the computer where it can tell what emotions you are feeling. It is an invasion of your pricavy. Like I said before they should only do it on paintings and not on real life people.\n",

After doing all that I went ahead and did more research just so if I found more about the landforms, then I could call the guy and let him know what's going on.\n",

You have probably heard that he face was created by aliens. You also might have heard some fact and some opinion. I am here to help you understand more about it.\n",

      "First off i would lke to say people have there own opion, but when it comes to facts you cant say its wrong. I have done a lot of research over the past 24 years.

      "The face became a priority to me and some scientists. The Mars Blobal Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet on in September,1997. The MGS flew over the face, Michael Malin and his Mars camera team took a picture that was 10 times sharper then the first photo. The photo revield thtthere was no alien monument at all it was a natural landform.\n",

      "On April 8,2001 the MGS got close enough to get a second, bettr picture. There were no objects in the face. If there was you would be able to see them,because each picture was 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the face is actually the Martian or a butte or mesa. Which are landforms common around American West. Therefore, the face was not created by aliens, and didnt have any object in it. Maybe you could do some more research about it .\n",

      "When I saw the pictures from 1976 to 2001 I saw one of the pictures and the picture from 1998 it looks like that something has hit the face and causing it to destroy it and to me it looks like a metor hit the face and in 2001 the face looks like its fading away and in 1976 it looks like it was popping out but when a metor hit it its goes away.\n",

I also have friends who think it takes up to much time away from what they want and need to do in their daily lives. I think that maybe if we have a requirement for at least one act of community service people will see how much fun it could be. Lots of kids today do nothing for their community. All they do is sit around and do nothing and having nothing to do leaves them at the vulnerability to commit wrongful acts against their community out of boredom. Kids are helping to mess up their community rather than helping to build it up so it can be a better place for the next generation of kids who will live there. You giving them the chance to do something for their community even if they don't want to will keep most of their minds of their minds off the bad things and on good things that others will appreciate. I myself have times when i am bored with nothing to do and i think \"Hey wouldn't it be fun to just reck something\", but i stop myself halfway in between that thought and call up one of my friends who help service their community and mine and ask if i can join with them to help out. I want my other friends who need more time to do the things they want and need to do to have more important and better thing to focus on in their lives.

If we force them they will just do a mediocre job. For the students who do want to do community service, you should let them know that they will be given high school hours or even college hours depending on there age and grade there in. I know because the high school I would like to go to SCHOOL_NAME requires me to have community service to graduate or move on to the next grade. If a student is though caught doing something wrong you should have him/her do community service for there punishment, but make sure it is clear to them that they do no get high school or college community service hours.

      "In my opinion, I believe you should require all students to preform community services at SCHOOL_NAME. I believe this for many reasons. The first reason being is that there are hundreds of kids at our school, and if each person does one community service , that doesn't even have to be big, think of how that could all add up! We could be changing the community one step at a time. When I say the service doesn't have to be big, I mean the smallest things such as throwing a couple of plastic bottles in a recycling bin or picking up some litter you see on the side of the street or in you neighborhood. My second reason being is there are some elderly people in Austintown that could use some help with simple everyday things, such as getting their mail or shoveling their driveway. Just doing those little things for a neighbor or friend could leave a great impression on Austintown children. But adults aren't the only ones that need help. There are elementary school children that struggle in school, such as math or any subject at all. As sixth, seventh, and eighth graders we should be good role models and help them with their weaknesses. We could tutor them after school for an hour making sure we get progress done. I understand that some students have after school activities, such as a sport event, so they would not be required to tutor. But it would be mandatory for them to do some type of service, such as picking up litter everyday. When all of these community services add up, we will be influences for Canfield and Boardman and other cities and they will do the same. When we come together like this, we can make a difference. Some students that disagree with this may thing the community is no big deal, but it is much more bigger than they think. Remember, a clean community is a happy community and when we all come together we can make a difference. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you take it into consideration.\n",

      "I do not think that community service should be mandatory because unless someone is jailed or imprisoned, even the law can't force them to do community service. I think it is unfair to force students to do community service because it is their decision to make. I am not saying that community service is bad. Actually, I think that I should do it more often. But you have to give the students a chance to make their own decisions as what to do for extracurricular activities. Imagine if every year, you were assigned an extracurricular activity. No fun in choosing it! Students should be able to choose what they want to do outside of school hours and off of the school grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem with this idea of community service is that it could take away from valuable family time and other activities, such as sports, parties, and even just taking a day and doing nothing. Students have less free time than ever nowadays. Are you saying that you want them to have even less free time? Preposterous! I know that I sound a little vehement, but I think community service is a great idea. Maybe you could have a community service volunteer extracurricular activity. Speaking from a student's perspective, the best thing you could do to lower morale around SCHOOL_NAME Middle School is force the students to do something that they don't want to do. I agree that a volunteer-based community service extracurricular activity would be very good, and I might even take part in it. But you already send us to school for 7 hours a day. Do you have to take away our free time, too?\n",
      "\n",
      "I stand completely and vehemently opposed to a forced community service activity for many reasons. Most of the students wouldn't try at all with the community service. Imagine a bored eighth grader that has to read to a group of cute little kindergartners. The student puts no effort into it and comes across as unmotivated and stupid. Now that would be a great way to lower your school's reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mandatory community service is just a bad idea all the way around the whole wheel. The kids wouldn't even have their heart in it. It would lower the morale around the school. Even some teachers are probably opposed to the idea of mandatory community service, and they would be unhappy. Your school's reputation would go down. You would take away the students' free time. You would take away their sports. Their activities. Their time with friends. Their time to do homework (don't you want them to do that?) . Their time to explore their passion and find things out about themselves. Their time to do anything. So, please, I beg you, I implore you to not make community service mandatory for all the students in the school.\n",

      "I think that you should not require all students to complete community service. One reason why is because we do not have time. Another reason why is because we could be focused on our school work. Also there are student that are apart of outside programs. This would really be putting stress on some of the students at SCHOOL_NAME.\n",
      "\n",
      "First reason students do not have time for community services. Some students really don't have time because they might play sports or have academics to focus on. If you went to practice then you just get out and you have to go do community services that id very tiring. I know because i play three sports and when I get out of practice I just want to go home and rest. Also what if some students have lots of chores to do and you had a long day at school then you'll have to do chores then community service. Now put yourself in our shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason why community service should not be required is because lots of kids should be more focused on school work. I think kids our age are already stressed out on trying to make good grades and if you make this a requirement that'll be really hard. Our grades will start dropping, early drop-outs, and depression. we should be focused on getting prepared for a test the next day or homework getting turned in.\n",
      "\n",
      "My last reason why is because most students are apart of outside programs. say that you are apart of the church choir and you have practice that is a lot to do community service than go to practice. Or you play sports or even if you have tutoring that's a lot of hard work to do for just a normal 8th grader. You guys should already know how hard it is to already do extra things in one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "First reason was we would not have time for community service. Another we said that we should be more focused on our school work. also I said that what we have other outside programs we were in that will b e hard work. This will be very stressful on a normal 8th grader sincerely STUDENT_NAME\n",

      "In my opinion I believe that all students should participate in a certain amount of community service. Not only is it great for our community but it improves a student as a person. If every student from the school decided to do a few hours of service the community would change for the better. Every student can do a little and we could change a lot. It can change a persons life and allow them to see what other people are like .\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many different opportunities when it comes to community service. One example is volunteering at a nursing home. Elderly people enjoy company and love to see young faces volunteering. In detail, my dancing school and I visit a nursing home every holiday season and perform a dance for the people to enjoy. It makes their day when they see us dancing. Also, when you leave you have a grin from ear to ear knowing that you made someone so happy by doing a task so small. Another example of community service would be picking up trash and helping improve the planet. There are several ways a student could do this. If your out side playing and you see some wrappers that are blowing around picking them up would do a lot for the plant. For example, one fall day my friends and I volunteered at a local farm to plant trees and clean up trash. After a long day of work we improved the environment by a ton. Also, it felt good knowing that we did something that benefited the entire community. Finally, you can do community service by volunteering for people in need. An example is at a homeless shelter. For example, every year in the winter time we send over one hundred pairs of gloves, socks and hats to people who can not afford them. It means a lot when I know that someone's life will benefit from a small gesture. All these tasks will certainly benefit the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion I believe that community service will benefit the students and the community. It is a great idea to offer the opportunity to all the students. Making someone smile is a great feeling to have. Also it takes little effort to make a huge impact on the community. So in my opinion our school should require students to do community service.\n",

How it is in the summer time and you have 2 do that and it is like a 95 degree weather? What made mall come up with the idea of doing community serves? You do that for people who deserve it or what?

We could have something like a carnival or let the students vote and pick a fun day activity. This kind of school activity would motivate the students to get out and be active in the community.\n",

I personally think it is their choice to do community work or not. Some may think it takes up time, and some may not, but I think that it should not be a mandatory option. I would like to do community work, but I would hate for it to be a job we have to do. I think that there is no use to it, if we are made to do the job. We would enjoy it regardless for helping the community, but personally if your asking me, we would actually be putting heart into it, if we chose to. You could make it to where we had three community service jobs, in two weeks time. Everyone should do community service in their lifetime, but I think it should be their choice when they do it, and why they do it. You should at least ask the opinions of students besides me, about the situation. So you could get an idea of which direction you should take. Don't get me wrong, this decision is all your choice, since you are the principal of the school, but I am just giving you my input of your idea. SCHOOL_NAME already have community service hours, ask yourself, should students outside of SCHOOL_NAME have to do it? well if your answer is yes, then just not make it troublesome of others. I am sure that other students would feel the same way about my idea, and have the same opinion as I do. It should be a well thought manner in your case. So my idea is yes, community service, but don't make it mandatory. I just would take some advice from others, and see what they might think.\n",

      "I know that your trying to decide if the students at school should perform community service or not, and I would like to help you decide quicker by giving you some reasons and examples why you should require all the students to perform community service, to get credits before high school and learn how to take a part in helping the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin on why you should require all the students to perform community service is to help them get credits before they get into high school. I know that the teachers, principal, assistant principals and the rest of the staff at the school loves to see when a students achieve. Everyone at the school has a big part in a student life and a way to help them is to give them a head start. While the other students in high school is trying to get their credits so they can graduate from high school. The new comers which is the 9th graders would have most of their credits in that area and not have to worry about it that much then the 12th graders that can't find a way to do community service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason why you should require the students to perform community service is to teach them how they can help the community by doing simple things and saving the Earth without having to \"Go Green\". For example, if the students are sent off to pick up some trash in the sand by the beach , they will learn what the trash can do to the animals if it stays there in the sand. Some of the students might become heartbroken. So next time a student goes to the beach on their own time, they might just pick up a plastic rapper or a glass bottle because they know what those items on the beach can do to a sea creature or animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude now you know the reason why should pick yes to require all the students to perform community service, so they receive credits before high school as well as take apart in helping the community.\n",

Me and a group of students have ourselves come to a conclusion that we would give you the advice to help settle this problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Job of community service can be tiring but a man like you knows that putting hard work into something is a good thing. We have all had something we didn't want to but as we all it is either good for yourself or your community in the end. It can be like a homework assignment in many ways because you may not want to do it but it is for your own good and the improvement of your class grade.\n",

      "This world is turning into a darker place. The problem is that people don't care enough. We see homeless people on the side of the street and no one stops there cars. We tend to ignore what is bad. Out of sight out of mind. I think that is ridiculous. We need to help others. If we don't then who will? All student should participate in some form of community service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucky for us we live in a pretty good town compared to others. In Africa people are starving and here people are dieting. Everything can improve though. We still have poverty. If we help those around us we will make a ripple affect and can help the world. Ann Arbor has a lot of good opportunities to help our community. Food Gathers is a great program that I have worked with many times. They take food that is being thrown away and sort out the good or bad. Then with that food they make meals and feed the hungry. I think we could get groups of student to help out there sometimes. It could be a fun field trip that also teaches valuable lessons. Many organizations like this are beginning to pop up. We all need to help though. One person can create a ripple but a group can create a wave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another growing problem we have is laziness. I'll admit I'm lazy sometimes too. When students say its a waste of time to help those less fortunate we have a problem. You don't need to spend hours but only a minute to help someone out. If someone is so busy with school work and extra curricular activities then they can go online and donate money, even just a dollar. Everyone can help they just need to know how and be motivated.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you help someone else you don't just help them, you help yourself. Helping those less fortunate is a humbling experience. You learn how to be a better person and you want to try harder in life. I once worked at a soup kitchen. I saw kids just like me with parents just like mine and they were starving. I am lucky and I learned just how fortunate I was there. I know that if some of the 'bad' kids went, they would appreciate what they have and be a better student. School isn't just about math and writing its about preparing you for life. An experience like this would defiantly teach you a life lesson.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service helps everyone. We can make a impact in our world by starting with just you and me. We need to motivate people to help, convince them that if they don't no one will.

At first i thought it would be boring but a few days later it was fun. I had to do 120 because me and other friends did trespassing at SCHOOL_NAME. It kinda sucks because i had to go to court and my mom and dad were mad because they had to pay 200 dollars for the ticket. That wasn't cool!! Well the next day i went that same school and they told me that i couldn't be there at all! and they also said that if they see me there at that same school they would call the police on me again. That's why you shouldn't drive fast or pass red lights because they would double the money. Now i noe not to go to that school again.

      "Well we can't be forced to do community service if we don't have to, volunteering is just fine. Because however we do want to do some things either than cleaning, just because it's recommended, doesn't mean we have to. If other people choose to do it by their own will, that's their choice, obviously. But other people do think differently and will go against it, which is what I'm trying to write to you of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if you \"require\" us to do community service even though we don't want to. It's like slavery for us kids. Though you think it's good for us, there's other people who would love to join the people who's volunteering for community service. Okay numerous of us are doing it, either it's punishments or volunteers or it's just your job period. It's good to do community service but really you can't force us unless you want slavery in the United States again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though I'm going against it, I'll still write you a pro about letting students take action on community service. First of all, we're just sitting down mostly our days watching TV and computer games. This would actually help us get to know more people, and be more social. Also, depending on what we're volunteering for, also a good work-out. For what reason this is going to effect everyone, making all your students do this requirement might get alto of parents to come to your school, just to punish their kids for doing certain things and bringing them into awkward situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, my point is not to require students for community service. Because it's just of course like forcing us again. For what I heard , slavery wasn't allowed in United States. We should get the right to do as we may, according to the law. Not everything , but in this case, we have the right to say no for educated students to perform community service by will. Some good may take in this course, but not all good. Though you think it'll be good for us students, learn some things. But for us, it's unfair and cruel. Somehow if you're volunteering as I wrote. It's okay because that's by their choice. So as I write this again, I say no to requiring students of our age and skill to do community service.\n",

Like when you see trash on the ground all you need to do is pick it up every little thing helps. Then when people go and help teach kids how to read and read to them that's helping them. Like how we have the club at our school that goes over to SCHOOL_NAME and reads to them and when i was in 5th grade my class would go to the first graders every now and then and read books to them it was pretty fun too. It wont hurt us either it will just make us and the other person stronger mentally. When we clean up around our neighborhood its helping us.\n",

      "Community service can teach our students how to be responsible. For example if the student is scheduled to go somewhere to help out with something it will show them that being on time is a crucial part of their job. Also if a student is doing community service by babysitting a child it will show them how to take care of someone and being able to help. Another example of how community service can make a student responsible is when the student is asked to do something they need to do it. This will come in handy at school with turning in assignments on time and putting in hard work.\n",

      "Community service will teach the students to care for others and not just for themselves. For example if a student is babysitting it will show them how to care for an infant or even a toddler. Also it will help teach students care by showing that if someone needs help doing something that he or she will help and not just stand there and watch. Doing community service can also show care for others by picking up trash in unwanted areas. These are all examples of how doing community service can help students care for others.\n",

      "Doing community service can also teach them how to have patients with others. For example if a student is asked to do a lot of things it will help them realize that helping others is no such a bad thing and that its good to help others. Another example of how it teaches patients is when a student is babysitting a child and the child will not go to sleep the student can read a book with the child and eventually the child will get tired and fall asleep.

      "I do think kids in the school should do community service. I think that because children should do some kind of physical work. they could do something active to keep them occupied instead of doing something they are not supposed to do. Things like this will keep the kids out of trouble. I think tutoring little kids is a good thing to help them get better at whatever they are working on. Its better than having nothing to do. cleaning up litter is good for the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion It is a good thing to do with your free time.\n",
      "\n",
      "other good things to do with your free time are doing extra work at the school. Work like help clean up the lunchroom after school. It is better than going home and playing video games and wasting your time. other people should start to know Its not always about what they want to do.\n",

      "I am addressing you on the issue if all students at SCHOOL_NAME should be required to do community service. I believe that each student should need some community service hours. Each student should do something to benefit our community. At the same time they should not be required a ridiculous amount of hours if the student doesn't think they should do community service. My reasoning for this is this community gives there tax dollars for us to get the things we do at this school. The least we can do is give back by doing something like cleaning, daycare, tutoring, etc. When deciding on this issue students need to think about that. If it wasn't for our community we wouldn't be allowed to get the education that we are getting.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time we do not need to have a surplus of hours put on a student to do. If passed a reasonable number of hours needs to be set. My reasoning for saying this is that if a student here wanted to do after school activates the community service does not need to interfere with things like sports and clubs. For example if I was on three teams witch I am and had to do twenty hours of community service, I would have a over planned schedule if I still planned on having exceptional grades So a student can be involved with those too witch I am a strong supporter of. This is my thoughts on this issue thank you for your time.\n",

      "Dear Principal,\n",

      "I ,as a SCHOOL_NAME Student, think that having community work should be required. Community work will help not just the community but will also help your self. Doing a little help for the community is not something that should just be thought of as not important. It should be something that people like to do, I mean its your community the place were you live, why wouldn't you want your city to look as great as any other place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a student here makes me proud to be who I am. Helping the community out is nothing to pay for just being here at this school. Without a community this school would not be here, even if it was no one wants to go to some dirty and totally nasty school. Why would you want that, when if every one helps out for just a little while your community would look great and then every one would want to go to your school or your community to live in, meaning more jobs, more money, and more families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I can see why someone would say, \"Help out the community, why would I do that. I have better things to do. That's why they have jobs to clean the city.\" Well that is true, but I say that if no one was to help the community why would any one want to come to a place were every is to lazy to help out the community. Which in turn will have people, say like your neighbor, who will need your help with something like putting up Christmas lights up, and you might just say no and say to hire someone to do it for you. The community is a place of friends and families growing up together, not fighting each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why I, STUDENT_NAME, say that the principle should have community service required. This is something that keeps the community together, friends who work together for a very happy community!\n",

      "My name is STUDENT_NAME and I go to SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing this letter to you because I wanted to tell you about my idea about community service, if all students should perform community service or not. I do not think that all students should perform community service. I think that it should be up to the parents. Or an extra curriculum activity after school hours or even before school hours. You could even give it to the kids that miss behave in school.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that the parents should be in charge of there kid in what to do, such as community service. If the child wants to do community service then let the student do community service. If they think that there children needs or even wants to be in community service then they could do it. I don't think it would be far to the kids who need to spend more time on there study's or even children that already have after school sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "An extra curriculum activity would be good also for the students. It may want more kids to go and do community service. I think that alot more kids would come to community service if it was an extra curriculum activity. Also if there parents new about it i think the parents would want there kids to be participating in community service. It would also be a good way for desaplan actions. For students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although not ever student is a good at paying attention to the teacher. why don't we give students community service instead of detention or worse. although it would be up the parents and the student in pick of witch he/she would rather do. community service would be the same amount of hours as detention just a shorter period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this will convince your mind into not having every student in the school do community service. Also maybe putting it to use like an extra curriculum. Or even letting kids have there pick in what to do between community service or detention. Thank you for reading this letter and please consider my ideas.\n",

      "\n",
      "But I think that everybody need to help and maybe it would be good to perform community service, so I think we should try to help more, and to do something that it's good for us and that help our school.\n",

      "We should do more good things for our school. Maybe it's not fun but everybody need to help in something, we have to do more important things for our school ant to learn that it's good to help the community.\n",

      "\n",
      "are helping to keep our community clean and to help other people understand that everybody does something for the planet. I see so many people litter in and outside of school and I don't think they realize how important it is to keep our planet clean. So we don't have pollution and other problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that we should start to recycle and by doing all of this more people might come to our school to enroll there children. The publicity could be good for our school and then later on for the students. The children can be learning good life lessons and it can help them to keep up the good work all the way threw there lives. It creates a good building block for the students and it will help our school and planet be clean. The more people seeing us clean up our parks and schools, libraries and neighborhoods the more people will also help to keep our planet clean.\n",

      "I picked twenty hours because It is not to much time, but yet students still have a chance of doing what they want on the weekends. We have homework and school five days a week and homework that takes two hours and over and doing to much community service will give the students no life for fun. If I had picked 45 hours the students would have to fun and that's what childhoods all about. So twenty hours is not too much time and you can still have most of your weekends free but you are also helping to keep your community clean and to show that you are a good student at SCHOOL_NAME and that you care about your planet.\n",

      "Community service is important in the world because it helps support ideas like cleaning up our neighborhood to helping the needy. If we didn't have community service, the world may not be a place like it is today. But, everyone has to consider that it is a persons preference to choose to do community service and that they are not forced to do it. Our principal may be doing a good deed in saying that everyone should have to do a certain number of hours of community service, but some people may not be able to and they shouldn't be forced to do any work that they don't have to. So i believe that the principal of my school shouldn't make this rule about community service.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the reasons that i think that his rule shouldn't be passed is because community service is important but it's only volunteer work that you should volunteer for and not have to be forced to do it. This is because i know from experience how hard it is to keep up with school work and how stressful sports, school, and family can be for a kid my age. Adding community service to this is not a good idea because i think that it may cause unneeded stress on stressed out kids that may not have the time to do this community service. so i believe that community service should not be forced upon kids of all ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason that i think forced community service is a bad idea is because it may cause a drawback in education for kids. This is because kids study after school and do homework and are over their heads in homework sometimes and community service may lead to more missing homework and lower grades on tests and quizzes, especially during the end o the marking period when the quarterly assessments are the most important and also the biggest test out of all of them. Community service would not be a good choice for the students at SCHOOL_NAME because of these reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final reason that i think forced community service is not a good idea is because kids need sleep. Without sleep, kids would do horrible in school and wouldn't be able to keep themslves awake. this would lead to drops in grades and would also lead to poor behavior in school because of lack of sleep. The reason community service may alter sleeping habits is because some communtiy service may require extra time in the evening which would keep the workers up late at night depriving them of sleep, which would be very bad. Community service would not be a good idea for SCHOOL_NAME because it would affect so many aspects of childrens lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service would leave children in many downfalls for many aspects of their lives because it may add unneede stress that may cause harm or even change them forever \\. so this rule should not be passed in SCHOOL_NAME\n",

      "The community is very important to most everybody but, I think the students at SCHOOL_NAME should take action and help clean up the community. Most people think its gross and not for them. Just imagine how much greater it will be if we all pitch in and clean up. They talk about on the news how ocean life is dying because of the trash on the beaches. Everybody does the things why not help? People don't understand what this does to our nation. My only question is WHY? No one can explain to us the things we do but I have to learn to deal with it, now I want to make a big change. In my life I grew up cleaning the sides of the road for fun now I want to do it to help all life from eating it and dying, especially for no reason! Please take some stand and make some of SCHOOL_NAME grounds cleaner and help make panthers really roar. We have a whole life to live why not live it right. To me it is very important and no one can take that away from me. So if you don't care then I'm ok with it. Almost every other day or more there is something said on the news about how the animals have been dying and people have discovered that its because they eat trash and they cant digest it and die. Everyone has a purpose and if you don't want to help then its okay, some day someone will want to do the same thing and you will be the one who makes that major change one day. Just remember to help and tell me what you think and if you like it then that makes a great start. Please say yes and help the community we need you to help! All i want is for you to say yes and if not then just let us make the difference without you.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, some students may not eligible because they need more help than others do and they can only do so much, but after a few hours or days they wont be able to do not as much anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand is that they would still be able to do work when they feel better. I know this because one of my friends are like this and when I go over to her house she is unable to do a lot of things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, when students might be doing community service they never know if one of their family members has passed and wont know till they get home. People has made my dad do community service, and when he got home he didn't have no clue his mom died. He wasn't able to go to the funeral because of community service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Some kids miss school and they miss class work and what they were supposed to learn that day. Kids can do community service in their yard and anywhere else they can think of. I believe students should do community services but only for the ones who has been disobedient toward their teachers and their classmates. The students who have been obeying and not acting up while in class should not have to do it unless they choose to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to thank you for giving me this time to speak with you and see my point of view of it. Community service is a good way for unpleasant kids should do and see if they learn their lesson. Have a good day sir\n",

      "and I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME in El Paso, TX. So TEACHER_NAME I have been tasked on a assignment for an opinion that students should be tasked to do community service at SCHOOL_NAME. So my opinion for students to volunteer for community service at SCHOOL_NAME is that I think students should be tasked for community service rather at a high school than rather a middle school and I have tons of reasons for this event.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my reasons is that students would get better advantages of getting community service at a high school rather than getting more disadvantages at a middle school. Another reason is that students that are going to volunteer for community service is that they get more opportunities at doing community service at lets say for example a swimming pool and you could volunteer as a life guard and you can help clean the high ways for litter than just doing community service at your own school rather like middle school you can only do community service only on the school campus rather than doing it someplace else. Another reason is that lets say for example you have to earn 20 hours of community service to pass a high school class and you can do those hours on the school days or the weekend unlike middle school you receive 15 hours of community service and you do it possibly every day but it can mess up study time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So TEACHER_NAME the reason that you should have students do community service at a high school is because you can socialize, work, and you can meet different people in the process and make them as friends rather than helping the same person that you already know. I hope when you read this TEACHER_NAME I think we could settle this and I can tell you my opinion is no. I hope you can understand this and agree of what I have to say about this event that I am tasked on. Thank you for your time.\n",

      "I understand that you are considering making all students here at SCHOOL_NAME do community service. Community service is a great thing, but it shouldn't be forced upon students. I think it's better to try and convince students to perform more community service, so they do it willingly and have fun doing it. I have come up with a plan to help you do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students are interested in many things, like music and sports, but they are much more interested in having fun. I believe that students see community service as boring, which is why they do not want to perform any community service tasks. If you can convince students that helping out in the community can be fun, they will definitely be more willing go out and volunteer their time and hard work. Students want to be with friends as much as they can. If one student wants to go clean up the park with the city council, they are sure to invite their best friend. Their friend will want to help because they're best friend is helping. They see it as more fun because they will be with someone they know. If we try a technique like this, the outcome can be great. If we create a group, here at school, of students who like to volunteer, we can definitely convince more students to help out of lovely city. Students will convince their friends to join, and quickly, we will have a large group of students that want to help. We can organize our own school volunteer work, or we can team up with the city council and work with them on city wide projects and events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students are usually only open to new things and experiences, when their friends are involved with them. If students learn that volunteering is fun, they will grow up and have this same mentality. They will have the chance to open themselves up to a new experience they are sure to love! Who knows, maybe one day they'll grow up to change the world!\n",

      "Community service seems to becoming a big problem her in our local community. I believe that students here at SCHOOL_NAME should be required to help out around our community and well do some community service. To make a community strong and united we have to work together to keep our community clean and healthy and this includes the people living in our community also. Below I am going to list some ideas on how to get our school to help around our community to make it a better environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pollution seems to be a huge deal around not only Crestview, but the whole Okaloosa County. I have come up with an idea that 10 students be selected from each grade every week, to go out and clean up the \"litter\" on our local highways. Pollution is something that can eventually wear away our ozone layer. So I believe that it is our duty as SCHOOL_NAME to take part in whatever we can to make our world a safe and healthy environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you like this idea I would be glad to discuss further details with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important part of a community is the people who make up the population of the community. Crestview is a town where everyone pretty much knows everyone, I think it would be a great idea to help out at our local nursing homes. Helping the elderly is always good, they love to see children's bright smiling faces. We could donate items at the school that we are getting or wanting to get rid, we can also cook meals for them. The community really needs strong young leaders to take control and get the job done that needs to be done around the community, and I believe that kids that make up SCHOOL_NAME middle school are the kids who can eventually make our community a better place for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who doesn't love a giddy little fund raiser, where you can buy everything you can think of. We really need to build new community center in Crestview and to carry that plan out we could do fund raisers. Fund raisers are a fun way of helping your community, I mean who knew that helping your community could be so much fun? Not only are you helping the community out of the goodness of your heart, but whenever you fund raise do you usually receive prizes? I believe you do, so this is a good way to help get kids to participate and help out around the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall TEACHER_NAME I believe that it is an awesome idea to have our kids here at SCHOOL_NAME to work together and complete community service. It would make our community happy and healthy for everyone!\n",

So elementary student go out and help our communities. Trust me you will always have the time to go out and do what you want to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "so come on and let us help out our community by cleaning up in our home towns. If our school did this as a group project we would not just be helping ourselves but a lot of people , animals, and countries. We could even recycle bottles newspapers and cans.\n",

      "Please let us go out and help our community, and save the lives of many creatures I don't just want my school to do this I want everyone to help make a difference in the world if everyone cleaned up a little bit every day I promise you we will be a happier and cleaner nation.

      "Students including myself, should NOT be Required to perform Community Service for Three Different Reasons. One reason is because It takes Up time of our everyday life. For Example, Students Will be exhausted and won't have enough energy or time to complete their EVERYDAY Homework If Community Service was Instructed. Teachers, School Employee's, and Parents are always hard on Students about Not completing their Homework or Schoolwork and this here situation will just make that task even worse. Time is being simply taken away from the Students if Community Service was Required and Students won't have any room to do some of their everyday Needs/Wants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another Reason Community Service is Not required by students Is because, Its deals with Tutoring Elementary Students, and Cleaning the Community. Don't get me wrong their's Nothing wrong with help other friends/associates out, As a matter of fact that's a good example Of Team Work. All I'm saying Is Tutoring should be done by a Teacher, After all they do get paid for TEACHING. And community service as in cleaning up litter, should be Done by the Citizens of Miami Gardens, Or Prisoners. I've seen Prisoners being watched to clean up the City of Miami Gardens. If these Things were done by School Students their would be no jobs for Teachers or The City Workers which means No money to Supply for Themselves, Kid, and Bills. Its okay for Students to do this but I just Don't think it's a Suitable Idea for Community Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, Community Service should NOT be required for Students to do because, Community Service should be something else instead of Tutoring, or Picking Up Trash. It should be a Meeting, with all The Citizens of Miami Gardens getting together, and Talking about ways they Could Do things better. For Example, Things such as, Not Polluting, Teaching better or to the point when all the Students understand, Should be Discussed At This Meeting. If this was done I Do believe their would be No Point/Need for \"Community Service\".\n",

I think adding community service to our school would mature our kids, and help our community be cleaner and better. our school has many immature kids here. All they do is disobey teachers, aids ETC.\n",
      "\n",
      "But adding community service bet would change the way our students act around here.

      "\n",
      "So my opinion on adding community service is defiantly yes. I think that our school would become a better environment. And mature All of the kids. So please recommend adding community service. But I think you should add it during school, because people got thing to do, people to see, and places to go. So I'm against it if its going to be after school. you should add another hour to school and have that be community service or something.\n",

      "As you know, many of your students here at SCHOOL_NAME like to help out in community service. In fact, over 1,000 of us here do help out. Shouldn't we require more students to help out as well, since the population of Florida, the state that we live in and cherish is over 1,000,000, 1,000 times more than the quantity of students that actually help out? I believe you, as the person in authority, should. Without community service, our world would be a wasteland in which non-contributors are useless people who sit around on there couches like \"couch potatoes\" and do nothing but watch television all day. If we don't want to end up like that, then you should require us to do community service because we would be helping others, we would build our kindness and morals, and we would express not only ourselves, but the whole state as good people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Us, the next generation of future adults, should act for our state and our country by doing community service because it assists others. It is a proven fact that humans make mistakes, and without the help and assistance of our peers, we wouldn't be anywhere in life like we are today. The same is true for other lost, lonely people in the world who are stuck in a \"sticky situation\". It is our duty to help them by performing community service. By doing community service, we would be helping those in need, an important factor in life today. Please consider the benefits you and the whole nation will reap from allowing us to perform community service, each and every one of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing community service also provides the kindness and morals that we, especially at this age, need. When we do community service about 100 times per two years, we would be helping out over 100 people in those years. Multiply that by the thousands of students we have here at SCHOOL_NAME will increase this tenfold. Doing all of this community service will increase our kindness levels and morals, making us a better person inside as well. When we grow up to become adults, we will need this kindness to prepare for the next generation and vice versa. If you allow us to do community service, it will increase our morals and kindness, which will be a continuity for hundreds of future generations, making our whole world a better place, so think of the world when you make this decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service also allows us to represent ourselves and the whole nation as kind people that like to help others. Without community service, this would be highly unlikely to happen. So it would be good to put the United States of America back in the running for best and cleanest nation out there. Think of all the great kids just having their potential wasted, being branded as bad students. Community service will help clean and revitalize those children, allowing them to express themselves and become \"good apples\". Please take this into consideration when you make your decision, TEACHER_NAME.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service is the exact opposite of a crime, as you help others, build your morals, and express the nation as your good self. In fact, it is so much opposite, it should be a crime, but thankfully it is not. It would be hard to perform community service by everyone, but that doesn't mean that they absolutely can't and that all of your students aren't capable. If you ponder on this though of having our generation perform beneficial tasks such as community service, I'm telling you, you won't be sorry.\n",

      "Dear principal i do think that we should help community service. I mean look at our economy, scientist have been saying that we have little tiny holes in our hemisphere because of us littering. You would think that after us hearing about that we would care more about earth and would start throwing our trash away where it belongs. My opinion schools should have the kids like once a weak pick up trash around the school, and during summer plant flowers and maybe even trees. The state should give the schools money so we can help the earth. Also instead of throwing our garbage in a hole why don't we burn it?\n",
      "\n",
      "What we also can do is help stores and banks. Why don't the state just pay for heavy duty windows and doors? If they care so much really they should do that, I mean yes people now a days are stupid and if they want to be stupid then they can be sent to jail i understand that but, when we can just make that certain stuff so that stupid people wont be taken from their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all the students out there in their schools that don't get taught well we should do something about it then just standing around. I mean like my school, a lot of peoples grades are down, not just cause of the students but because of the teachers. For example one of my teachers when i raise my hand for help she helps me on a completely different topic that i never asked for. I think that we really need to take a foot down and have the state help us with what ever that we need. Also in SCHOOL_NAME they complain how the students are failing a lot of the classes, but to be honest if they care that much they wont give us super hard problems on the test and homework, and for the algebra students teachers give them homework that the teachers hasn't even gone over.\n",

Even if we don't have much time we can help with the simple things there is to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think students should be required to have at least 17 hours of community service. But just for their last year at the school. It shouldn't be mandatory for those students who are in the lower grades. The school should make students realize that we need help in the environment and laziness from them wont help.\n",

While the community is improving the students are getting community service hours. For example the community has a lot of trash and other objects needing too be cleaned up. If the trash is cleaned up then maybe it could even reduce some of the pollution in our community.\n",

If students are forced to take time from themselves in order to make the world a cleaner place then that is not right because this is a free Country and we should not be imprisoned to listen to everything and do everything that an authorised figure asks us to do. You can make the work extra credit. If you do not listen to this request than my friends and I will gladly go on strike, transfer, or not show up to school until this issue is resolved. The new building for SCHOOL_NAME is not finished yet and the community service will not be either if this community service is not avoided.

      "Community service is a really great thing to do in life. Most people in this community are in need of help. Helping the community makes the world a better planet to live on. It is really easy helping them too. For example, things you can do to help the community is to go to the hospital, babysit, and visit the sick to volunteer. By volunteering, you are supposed to help people out by working for them for a couple hours a day. I require all the kids in in school to be required to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you go to the hospital, you can help the community out because in some hospitals there are people that live there because they are too old to take care of or they have some kind of mental disability or illness. The people there are usually just old with some sort of sickness. It is hard for them to be able to do actions we are doing because they don't really have enough strength to do actions us, children and teenagers can do. It is good to help out because you can change there life in a better way.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you babysit, you can really have fun with the kids you are with. You can see and learn everything about a kid. Most of them are very fun to play with however, there are a few that give you a hard time taking care of them. Parents usually ask you to babysit sometimes because of the work times they have or when they have to go to a party together. If you really enjoy being with kids, this is something to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you visit the sick, you can really help them turn a frown upside down. By this quote I mean that they are all usually sick and in pain most of the time. They really don't like having to deal with the fact that they can't do what cured people can do. You can also talk to them and tell them about your life and learn a little bit of there's. They always like having someone to talk to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, I think volunteering is a brilliant idea to do. i think it's a good idea because you can change a life and you can make the planet a bigger and better place to live in. This is why I require all the kids in this school to be required to do community service.\n",

      "It is in my best interest to inform you that the students at our school need to know what it feels like to help others, therefore I suggest that all students need to perform some kind of community service in order to learn the values of helping others. I have come to realise that some students like helping their community and others do not 'Why should they have to do community service if they don't want to?' you may be asking this question, but ask yourself this, 'Why shouldn't it be important for students to help their community?'. I believe that it is important because it really does prepare students for the future by showing how helpful they can be when they work together to help others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, I think that community service helps people grow as a person because they learn to rely on others. This is important because in the future when they have a job they are required to work with others and by doing community service they will be prepared for when that time comes. My younger sister, RELATIVE_NAME, goes to SCHOOL_NAME and is involved in community service, as far as I'm concerned I honestly think that it's a good idea because not only does it prepare them for the future, it also helps them to know their fellow students a lot better.\n",

      "Lastly, I would like to say that community service helps students, and all people in general, to make new friends and build strong bonds. Our community is in shambles because of distrust between our fellow Americans, so why should we let that happen to our students? I don't know why some people would say they could care less about what happens whether it's not having enough time or they don't know what to do. Well, it's time to make a choice, either deprive the younger generation of trust and friendship or help them prepare to make a better future. What's your choice?\n",

      "\n",
      "I see a community were there is no trash in the roads or fields, there are kids helping their elders, and even students wanting to help the community, this can be us. Some of the activities that would easily be assessed are cleaning up trash and caring for the elderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, picking up trash would be good and easy to participate in because it can almost be treated like a field trip where students will be brought to a designated location where clean up is necessary and the students will clean up the roads and fields to have better land and less global warming because of the littered trash.\n",
      "\n",
      "This form of community service would be easy because it would take less than two hours, so the kids can leave the school and come back in the blink of an eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuing this further, another easy and good act of community service is looking after and taking care of the elderly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe this would be easy but a little more difficult to plan the picking up trash because the students will need to leave and come back from the homes of the elderly at different times so most if not all of the elderly citizens of our community can be helped and cared by the students at SCHOOL_NAME.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a result there would be less fatalities of the elderly by falling because of the students with them to help care for them.\n",

First I have 120 Hours of community service over my one and a half years at SCHOOL_NAME and they weren't that hard to get. Second it makes you a better person by just one act of kindness. Third it a chance for students to help out in there community.\n",
      "\n",
      "First there is a class here called community service and leadership in that class you are required to do at least 10 hours of community service. I took the class and ended up doing really well so now I'm one of 16 kids in our school who are junior advisers. It's kind of like a student council. I went above and beyond 10 and got 48 by the end of the school year last year. I found it kind of fun to be honest. Now since then I have gotten 72 hours. I Think that every kid should try for ten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second it makes you feel good one time I escorted senior citizens to there seats in a theater then took there walkers. Then at the end of the show I brought all the walkers back and gave them to each person. When I got home I felt good for such a simple thing and I think students don't realize how much it does for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally its a chance to see what kind of things are going on in the community and to get involved. One time I volunteered at a ware house where they put together luminaries in kits. Before then a bag would just be on my door step in mid December with stuff to make luminaries, I never really thought where they came from or who put them together.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Personally I think every student and possibly teachers in our school should be required to take at least 10 hours of community service.\n",

      "People that volunteer get a couple good things out of it. First of all you get to help others and it might just be the smallest thing that you do to help people. One easy thing that would be very helpful is to help out a younger grade teachers for about a hour and just help the students read or write or anything that the teacher would need help with.

It is also an opportunity to help us get ready for collage, if the school makes a program of community service and students have to help it would give us more opportunities to go to a decent university. If teachers and our parents help us to get involved in this kind of things we can get a better future and is not only for our future it is also for the next generations that will come to this school. But this is not only to benefit us it is also to benefit the people we are going to help. The community gives us a lot so i think we should give something back as a thank you. We don't want for the future generations to live in a disgusting community so we should all get together to clean up this place. But that is not all we should do we should also go to orphanages and to elementary schools and to hospitals to help. We could read to older people and teach how to read and write to orphans. Helping around the community should be a requirement to each student that is going to graduate from any school. Now as young adults we should help and not make a mess.

      "DEAR principal my name is STUDENT_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME .I come to you today to try to help decide on weather you should require students to do community service, my thoughts on this are that the kids should do community service it will help them become more responsible and respectful to and for there community. children don't always know what's best for them selves, usually they are pretty good about it but if it involves work or time away from fun the dislike of it. If we make it a requirement they tend to buckle up and do it. What im am trying to get at is that kids always need a push to succeed and if they do this and complete it i will be not only a push but a good start to there future career's. I hope you make the right choice for are future leaders of this country. give these kids an opportunity to make there life's better.\n",

He has also been predicted not proficient in class. To assist him in becoming an excellent student his guidance concealer suggest community service in teaching the youth. After realizing he could help other people manage their time wisely he also got into the habit of proceeding the same way in school. Community service can make a difference in an everyday students life therefore it must be required at our school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experience in your future career is absolutely a wonderful way to benefit our students in choosing a career for the future. Community service can provide time for students to get a feel on a certain subject in which they are interested in. For example, I always had an interest in working with children. Volunteering at my local church has been a wonderful experience and i also have been educated in ways i wouldn't be able to learn on my own. i feel as if I'm completely prepared to take an internship any given day.

TEACHER_NAME, i inform you that it's important to require students to have community service in school because students experience giving back to their community. Also, community service helps keep students out of trouble. TEACHER_NAME , you should really consider requiring students to do community service.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, community service help keep students out of school. Many scientist say that fixity-nine percent of students will go into gangs or other worse things if they don't have something to do after school. Once their was a student that was always bored after school. One day one of her friends ask her if she wanted to join a club after school ,but it turns out the club was actually a gang and the student ended up in the gang.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, community service should be required because it experience students about giving back to the community. Statistics say, many students like to give back to their community. In one school, the students love to do community service because they get to help their community in several ways, like cleaning up trash and other things.\n",

      "Just take a moment to think about how your community is around you, Think off how our world and community is, Think about everything that is happening to our school campuses, and this is why I believe that students should be required to perform community service.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, students have nothing much better to do other than go hang out with friends or be home doing nothing. For example, when students are in school what are they doing ? Most of the time yes we're doing work in our classes but think about after lunch when you have nothing to do, us students should take the time to help make our community a better place even if its just by picking up a few pieces of paper off the floor. With just those couple of papers you've made a change in our lives. Also think about when students go through passing period most of the time all the students do is stand there and talk, you should put students to do community service it'll give them something to do other than waste valuable time that can be used for something good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point to consider, community service will keep some students off the street so they wont make a bad decision and end up in a bad situation or hurt. For example, just last week there was a boy named OTHER_NAME he was fourteen years old and went to SCHOOL_NAME. One day he was hanging out with his friends and I guess he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time because just that day he ended up getting shot. I believe that if schools made kids perform community service things like this wouldn't happen because students will have spent more time in school helping to make a difference other than being out on the streets possibly about to get hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, this is why I believe that students should be required to perform community service. It'll keep some students off the streets, give students a chance to help make a difference, and also I believe students should perform community service because most students don't have anything better to do.\n",

We should help our communities.\n",

By doing this, the tourists will begin to say good things about the city of OTHER_NAME and the city of OTHER_NAME. We will receive more tourists and people interested in moving to OTHER_NAME or OTHER_NAME. We could even assist the needy, if we assist the needy we will look like a community that cares about our residents. When we help the younger we are helping our future lawyers and doctors even our future engineers with their education.\n",

We will feel good about ourselves and we will want to participate in more activities to help our community.\n",

      "Many students argue that community service is nothing that requires them, but many adults and some students feel it is an important part of our world, and it's an activity that everyone can participate in. Everyone needs to help change the world, and I agree that community service is a big deed that students should be taking a part of, but a lot of students claim they don't have enough time. Doing little things like walking your neighbors dog, or help babysit your cousins is enough for students who have extracurricular activities, and boat loads of homework. Many students do participate in community service, and many also do extracurricular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main reason students say that they cannot participate in community services is because they play sports, or are on the dance team, or in English festival. They participate in something extracurricular, therefore they don't have the time between games and practices to balance out there schedule and their grades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The students grades are another important reason to either decide if or if you cannot participate in community services, let alone extracurricular activities. I think if there is a student or students who do not participate in any extra activities, and keep there grades up, I think they can be a part of community services, as well as other students who participate in the activities, outside of school hours. I think the school should have a sign up sheet which requires every student to sign up for a community service. Now, not all community services are giving away food to the homeless, it's a simple thing such as tutoring a younger student, or cleaning up the lunchroom so all the volunteers who prepared the lunch don't have another burden on their shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think all students should do something for the community not just at home, but maybe the school can volunteer and help with the community service. Every student should do at least 2 community services. Maybe one at home and one at school. Just because some kids are complaining that they have to much homework or to many practices doesn't mean that they can't throw in a little extra time for the community. Go to study hall or try to get some of your work done in school, instead of talking. If you are struggling with school work, then try to focus on that and then go towards the community services once your ready and caught up with school work.\n",

When kids don't understand now of the possibilities of their future they are at higher risk of them becoming one of those people.

Then after, we could take it and donate to any shelter that needs it the most.

I think it would really say something about our school and SCHOOL_NAME would take a leader role in the community. The students should be out helping the community rather than sitting on the couch eating potato chips. In just one hour, there can be a lot of beneficial improvements towards the community. This service can also count towards kids National Junior Honor Society and service hours for Conformation or Bar/Bat Mitzvah's. Service hours can show a lot about someone's character and I think if all students were required to do this, everyone's character would build and get better. The community as a whole would become much better. Students can learn from helping out the community and might find a passion for a particular service. Others will realize that all these students are really trying to make a nicer community and then the other's will feel obligated to help out too. It takes a special person to really be dedicated to community service. The students will learn more about themselves and what they can do that will really help out society. If students start making positive attributes to the community you might see less crimes going around. This will also lead to students making better decisions and seeing themselves as a different person. Students will be honored by their community and should realize how much you put into to your community is how much your community will give back.\n",

      "I know that you are debating whether students should be required to perform community service. In my opinion, you shouldn't. Students enjoy having time on weekends to see friends, go shopping, and visit with family. If you required them to do community service they wouldn't be allowed to do these things. Also, if students had to do community service after school they would have limited time to do homework and study. Their grades would probably drop. Now don't get me wrong, I think community service is a great idea. It's a wonderful time to help out, volunteer time, and donate. Although, I don't think many students would be too happy if they were forced to do this. Most schools have Honor Clubs with students with exceptional grades and characteristics. These students volunteer their time and as a reward they get to go on field trips to amusement parks and other fun places. These are the students who should be helping out in our community. They get to volunteer if they want to and if they don't, it's their loss. I am one of these people and I think helping out in my community is really fun and fulfilling. Instead of making community service a requirement, you should create a club with rewards and fun projects that have to do with helping out. I think it would really be worth the time and effort. Why, you might even find your community becoming a better place! Thanks so much for you time and understanding. I hope you consider my idea.\n",

Me being part of this schools large student body, is not proud of such a huge decision. If you think about it volunteering is a great help to communities and some of the people volunteering themselves. Most students though really need to perform community service. For example, students that are part of SCHOOL_NAME have to get volunteer hours. Some people just don't have time to complete such tasks. In fact 65% of American students are given so much homework and projects they only have 12% of time left in the day to do different activities. It is a large request to enforce such an important rule so I would not require students to do community service, unless told to do so. I would let my pupils of this school be given many opportunities to perform community service though. Hopefully you will not enforce this rule at our school.

As our community is relatively dirty, and has a lot of trash and litter everywhere, I certainly think that all students should participate in community service at least once over the school year. I think that the town certainly needs a clean-up and this is a great way to do it. Of course, most students have busy schedules, and may not be able to participate in it on a certain day. As a community, we need to take care of it ourselves and therefore, all students should be required to take part at least once over the year.

This causes diseases and other sicknesses that could possibly be fatal. Well, as it is our community, I definitely think that we need to do a large pick-up at least several times a year. For example, in the neighborhood of Trianon, families will take out the trash and then it will blow away, and they don't care one bit. If a neighbors pet eats something that blew away, you could get sued and the pet could get very sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "As some students have a busy schedule, they may not be able to take part in some of the days where we do community service. Therefore, I think you should definitely make ten or more days where students can come out and do something good for the community.

      "I think all students should do community service because some students have to much time on there hands. Also students should do community service because our world would be better whether its just cleaning up the litter from people that throw things on the grown or to go to different elementary schools and help the younger kids with work. If our students at SCHOOL_NAME were able to do community service i think our community will be a lot better. Our community would be better by our kids and parents in the local district being happier and also they would be happier in what we did in our community by making our community cleaner and safer. I believe if we were able to do community service at our local elementary schools students would learn to like school better and learn that what ever they do in school it can get you a good job, also it would get kids to have a better education. Also for kids to help our community to get up and go help out our planet by making good choices and going out and picking up peoples litter because our animals out there are getting hurt. Our birds our fish and other animals they are just like people and people wouldn't want there homes looking trashed by the litter. The same with our animals it would help our animals live in better and safer homes. If we had community service at SCHOOL_NAME middle school our community would be better.\n",

      "I heard about what you are trying to get students to do \"community service\". I do think this a good idea and i want this to happen but there are some students that might not even care about this and not follow along with this plan. I would think it would be better to form a group at school and let students who would want to help with this process. Some students don't have the time to go help, even if you forced them to help out. Plenty of students have after school activity's that they cant miss out on. I do agree with you 100% but i don't think it will work a bunch if we just made kids do it. Lets just try at the beginning of this process to make a club at school for the people that are interested and will participate with all their effort on community service and if they like it well maybe they can make a speech of how great it if to help out in community service. I would really want some kids that are not involved in a lot of activities through out the school year and that are not doing good in their grades, because i think it would help them out to figure what's out there in this big world and it would also probably help them get their grades up. If you ever need help in something with activities like these i will always be here to help with SCHOOL_NAME\n",

By doing this students will have the opportunity to help people in need, help the environment and feel good about doing things for their city.

      "\n",
      "By students performing community service it gives them the opportunity to have fun by helping the environment. For example, if all the students from each grade got together and went somewhere in their community and planted trees, that would be a great learning experience for the students and teaching them about how global warming is effecting our planet would be a great way for the teachers to encourage the children to do more with helping the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, by children performing more community service it gives them the chance to help others. For example, students could go on a field trip to a local nursing home or a homeless shelter and sing Christmas carols to the residents around Christmas time. I would have loved to have done something like that in school but it was never required that we do community service so it was not done. Also by doing this, the residents would enjoy it and would talk highly about the school.\n",

      "I think that not everyone should have to do community service. I think that because if people would rather do other personal things that they would like to do on their time i do not think that it is fair to make them do community service when they do not want to. Also I do not think that kids should be required to do community service because many children have very busy schedules with school sports and many other extra activities in and out of school. So i don't think that it is fair to make children do community service when there schedule is to full to do it. Another reason why I don't think that community service should be mandatory is because some kids already helped out by doing some things in school so I think that it should be their choice whether they would like to participate in community service or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with all of that being said I think that those children who do participate in community service and helping our environment. For example at SCHOOL_NAME, if someone helps out with community service they should receive a pride coupon for helping and giving back to our environment. So I think that if the children are generous enough to take some of their time out of their day to help the environment they should be awarded with something special in all schools across the United States.\n",

      "I think that helping out our community is a great thing but I do not think that we should have to force kids to help the environment if they are not doing it for all of the right reasons and just doing it so that they could go home and play their video game but like I said before I think that all of the children who do help out with giving back to our environment should be thanked for what they have done for our country.\n",

      "Have you seen our earth? It needs help. That's why i think you should make kids do community service! It will make our earth cleaner. I will tell you a couple reasons why i think kids should do community service!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well to start off, i think kids should do community service is because all kids do when they get home from school is watch television and play video games! But with everyone coming together we could make this place a more efficient place to be upon. I also know some kids wont be happy about this, but when they realize they are working together to help the community they should feel better about themselves. Kids should get out of the house more often and help out with the environment. I hope kids start getting out more to help out our healthy world.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, I think there are plenty of things to do outside! A couple examples to do outside would be to pick up trash or tutor someone. If you pick up trash, people might notice and they will stop throwing stuff out of there car window. They also might help pick up trash. If you help someone else they other person will benefit with a better education, that will be needed for a good job later in life, or the kids might be nice to other people since you were nice to them! You might want to do other things that i didn't mention, and that is fine! As long as you make it to were the kids at SCHOOL_NAME do community work, this planet will be looking good in no time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, I think it is good to help out. You can get a lot by helping others! If you do sports or something in that category then you could be recognized at the end of the season for volunteering outside of school. This could be useful if you want to do something and you have a good back ground! Getting recognized for helping out is a great way you could be a better person! TEACHER_NAME if you let children help out, it will be great for them!\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I told you it would be a good thing for the kids so they are not at home watching television and playing video games all day! Then i also told you there are plenty of things to do outside for the environment! Finally i told you it would be good for kids to help out with the outside world, not just in school! I no it'll take time away from school, and we need our education but if you think about it kids may want to help out, some might just be to afraid to say something!\n",

      "we can also clean up our streets and we could have some kids donate food to a homeless shelter. The reason why we should do all this is because so the people that can't afford food can have something to eat. Picking up trash can be a great way to help the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have some friends that would love to help out with this and plus you won't be board because you will have your friends with you to keep you company and also help out in your community. This junior high school has a lot of thing that we students can do to make it a nice school like we could pick up trash if we see it in the hallways just by doing that we make it cleaner and keeping out lunch rooms clean that could make it clean too. We can donate food that goes to waste everyday at this school to anther school or homeless shelter that needs the extra help. If we just take some time out of what we do everyday and just help by visiting a nursing home and we could just make their day and students could go play with little kids and read them books. This is why I think all students should do community service and plus your helping out your community the place where you live and just by doing all that you could make a big difference.\n",

      "\n",
      "I have many ideas for community service but here are three and I will start at something pretty simple. A day on Long Beach Island's famous beaches picking up all of the garbage. It is outright disgusting to see cigarette buds on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "That would help bring people to LBI.\n",

      "Have you ever been forced to do something you do not want to do? Well you are putting your students in that situation if you make community service mandatory. You must not require the students to perform community service. The reasons are students may not have the time to perform community service, the students are not forced to do anything they do not wish to do, and the some of the parents will disagree if the operation is carried any further.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the reasons students should not be forced to perform community service is the students may not have the time to . Students have a life outside of school. If its sports, piano lessons, or doctors appointments. If the student misses one day because of those examples, the students will somehow be punished. It may be getting discipline for the teacher of losing credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason students must not be forced to perform community service is students are not forced to do anything the do not wish to do. This is America, the land of the free, and the home of the brave. People have a choice if they want to perform community service. Why can't students have this same choice? They will also be adults some day. Some people may say since they go to school they must perform community service. But community service is not a written law. Until community service is a written law like school is,I am not forced to perform anything i do not wish to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final reason why students shouldn't be forced to perform community service is what the parents may say about this. Most parents will agree with this, but some will not agree with this. one or two parents may refuse their child to perform community service. The only thing that will do is hurt the student. He of she will get punished for not doing this requirement and be put in an alternative call. The student will also get bullied. The student will be look differently if he of she doesn't participate and some students will bully this student for something that is not his or her fault. Those are the reasons why the students shouldn't be forced to perform community service, the students may not have time, students are not forced to do anything they do not want to, and some parents will not agree with this requirement if it is carried on.\n",

      "To me community service is important and all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME should be required to participate in community service. Community service is very important. I believe responsibility for serving these hours should begin in sixth grade with a requirement of about ten hours. Then the hours per student should increase as the grade the student is in increases. If students are required to achieve service hours it will do a lot of good for them and for their community.\n",
      "\n",
      "A positive consequence for the students at SCHOOL_NAME would be preparing them for high school. At most Catholic high schools community service is definitely a big part of a student's education. At SCHOOL_NAME or SCHOOL_NAME, service hours are required in a large quantity. This is one reason why I think community service would help the students of SCHOOL_NAME\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason is to teach kids at young a age the great part about helping people. Sure you could just tell them it is good to help somebody but telling them won't put them in a habit of helping. If the students go out and help others on a pretty regular basis then it will become a habit of helping others and they will do something to help more people in their community without having to think twice about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service would also be a great advantage for SCHOOL_NAME and attract more people to this school. People who see students from SCHOOL_NAME helping in their community will want to send their child here. Most parents would like to send their child to a school with community service to teach him or her morals and discipline. It would be excellent for SCHOOL_NAME to adopt this idea of community service.\n",

It will help the community, it could help with their character, it could be added as a credit for high school, it looks good on a resume', and they could possibly have fun. I would do community service, but it would be a lot more fun if my friends were with me. Maybe that's what needs to be advertised about community service; 'you will help the community and you'll be with the people you have fun with.' I could get some of my friends together and we could plant a tree, or pick up trash around campus, or on the streets, or even on the beach. We'll get it done and we'll have fun doing it. So yes, I believe students should give back to the community and help out for once. Maybe some of the students will like helping society and want to do it again, or even as a hobby. And I'm sure there will be some students that think it's a total waste of time, but at least they tried it and helped out a little. It's a good chance to take if some of the students will actually like helping and they'll do it again and again and they even get their friends to come help next time.

If you make it a requirement to have students perform community service i think that it won't only help out our society but also change the minds of kids who think this is a punishment and instead think of it as a great way to help. Kids would gain more exercise by picking up trash on the grounds. They will be a help to many children younger than them if they tutor elementary kids. And they will help out our society way more if you require all students to perform a certain amount of community service a week or month.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that students being required to perform community service for a certain amount of hours is a good idea. By having students go outside and pick up all the trash outside of their school, near by a grocery store, or even park would help out not only our society but the students themselves. Students can gain a lot of exercise just by going outside for a walk. It doesn't matter whether they're just walking or doing a great thing for our world by picking up trash on the ground. Either way students are still getting energy and exercise out of this requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lately in Connecticut, our education scores have been dropping, more and more students are doing bad in certain subjects. If students with knowledge in a certain subject could tutor a younger student who is in need of help that would help us tremendously.\n",
      "\n",
      "One student can make a difference in a school just by tutoring other students. This could help Connecticut scores move up from around the top 20 smartest states in the world to one of the top 5. Just like it was years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Society today is not doing that well. More and more electronics are coming out so less and less people want to go outside get fresh air and help the community. If Principals start to require students to perform community service for a certain amount of hours than our society will look and feel 100 times better than before. Kids can start picking up trash helping people shovel in the winter to help others from causing crashes, and just helping whenever needed. This would definitely help out our society and the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion I ,a former student at SCHOOL_NAME, think that it is a good idea if our principal starts requiring students to perform community service. If this happens children of all ages will help make earth better by going outside to pick trash up but also by getting exercise by being outside walking/looking for trash. They could tutor other children to make Connecticut one of the smartest states like it use to be. Also it'll help our society look and feel better than it ever has.\n",

There are all sorts of things to do from spending time with the young and elderly to cleaning the city. Some students think that doing stuff like that is boring because their not getting paid. It doesn't matter who you are or what race you are it matter about everyone coming together as a family. When you here the words community service you automatically think that its for bad people , but it's not. I would describe community service as a chance to reach out to people. It's just not about cleaning up you can have fun raisers. You can also have community get-togethers to help support breast cancer or something like that. It really doesn't matter just show your community some love and I hope the students and teachers of SCHOOL_NAME understands that.\n",

However, I would consider revising it a bit. I advocate any form of community service. I believe it builds character while helping other people in need. We take too much for granted any way. Helping other people in need is a good way to make us more appreciative of what we have, and perhaps even help us use these things we take for granted in moderation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that you know my stance on community service, you will better understand my ideas on this plan of yours. First of all, community service would have to be done outside of school, and it's rather impractical to give it as homework. This is because some kids don't have transportation to places they can do community service. We also need to focus on our school work.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we could start making our Environmental Club more serious. By that, I mean that it would have a bigger place in our school, enough to where other schools would even hear about it. We can do more community service in the club, and show the other students what we did, encouraging them to join. You could also have a school assembly to inform the students of the benefits of doing community service. Besides helping other people, having community service hours on your resume is a monumental help in getting a job or getting into a good college. And helping other people helps us become better people, morally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping what I have told you in mind, what would be the best solution? Overall, the best thing we can do is encourage the students to join the Environmental Club, and inform them of the benefits of community service. And if we accomplish bigger and bigger jobs, then we could even get publicity in the newspaper. This way, readers would be inspired to go out and help others.

I not only mean us student but the employees of SCHOOL_NAME too. The more the better and if not how about just extra credit or something. I'm sure that many people here wouldn't mind helping the homeless or cleaning up the sides of the Highway and the Boulevard. There are many people that would back me up so for our great town of California have your decision not be held on not to do it because it would take to much time or be to hard to see the students time cards or whatever they need to be signed.

      "There has been a lot of controversy on weather to require all children of SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service and although this would be good in some ways this would be worse for many reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first reason is that forcing children to work on community service is that it takes time away from extra curricular activities. It's a common known fact that America has problems with obesity. Making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. This would increase obesity rates in America even more, causing the life span of children in this Country to shrink.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work, rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun, like a hobby. Community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids, the environment or those who need help. This wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. If a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work.\n",
      "\n",
      "My third, and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home. There is no doubt that children in this very room that I'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the 8th grade. Forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at SCHOOL_NAME. This would not only be problematic for the children that are failing, but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.\n",

I know sometimes you think picking up trash is nasty but it's not only helping you, but it's helping the community and your planet. Not all community service is picking up trash sometimes it's recycling or car pooling or even just turning off a light when you leave a room. I also think everyone should do community service because wouldn't it be nice for a change to see all students do work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service to me is a change. We make changes everyday, but when we make those changes think about the world and how you should help it. If it was up to me community service would be the only options, because some students have time to come out and do community service but some chooses to go home and dent the couch, and that's just selfish. TEACHER_NAME you know when you tell us to do what we are suppose to do, it goes threw one ear and out the other. Why waste anymore time making suggestions and start making orders.\n",

      "I believe that everyone wants to have a litter-free community where everyone can live and be safe when exposed to the conditions outdoors. School especially since it is indeed the main occasion where many students are daily spending their days at. With that being said, I would like to let you know that the world would surely be a better place if everyone would cooperate and help out the community by doing community services. When people think about community service, most people would think of punishment; something that juvenile delinquents does as a punishment. That is not the case however. It is just something that would really help out the world and plays a major role in many lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first reason why I truly believe that every children and adult should at least do some community services is because it helps out the world in a major way. Going around the block and picking up little pieces of trash or picking up bottles and recycling it really does help out. One person can truly make a major change. Your neighbors and home where you live in is the main place that should be kept clean so that you would feel safe to go out and not worry about getting sick and such.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many kids and families in Africa for instance, however does not have a clean environmental economy. Every day they're exposed to many conditions such as diseases, bad fevers, and other conditions affecting their health. When you see how they're living, it's truly a horrible sight to see. On the other hand, America is a much more different society. When everyone cooperate and helps out, you can prevent these things from happening. Our place is much more easier to clean than in Africa and all we need to do is contribute. I believe everyone has a good side to themselves even though they don't realize it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping the world clean is a great thing, but there are also some other community services that you can do. This would be things such as taking care of animals in animal shelters. Every living thing deserves respect and when you show love towards animals, it really makes them understand that even though they have been through a lot in their past, they still have a great future ahead of them. Not only is taking care of animals a great thing, but at the same time you can be having a lot of fun!\n",
      "\n",
      "So in conclusion, TEACHER_NAME, I know that with the help of everyone from around the world and especially in our community, the world would be a better place. Whether it's from humans to animals, plants to cars, if the world was kept clean and the environment safe, having community service will enable a lot of great things in life!\n",

      "I think you should require kids to partake in community service. It could help troubled kids out and take away the pressures in life. It could teach kids the meaning of helping others and to not be selfish. Community service can also help those who are in need of food or need a tutor to pass whichever grade they are in.\n",

      "Community service could help the people who are involved in gangs to stop and help others. This one kid in the ninth grade was in a gang, but stopped because he started community service.

      "Community service can be fun for everyone. Students can have fun with their friends while doing something for others. It is also a great opportunity for us students to make new friends, or grow closer to our old friends. This would also be a good opportunity for us students, the faculty and the teachers to grow closer as a family. If ICS were to help out at a soup kitchen, it would be fun for all of us to work together and cook, clean, and make others happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service is educational. While doing community service hours, students can learn how to do things that they didn't know how to do before for example; cleaning up litter at a local playground and at our church. This would give students a chance to learn about the environment and be more aware of the planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Community service is a great way to have service hours. Service hours are very helpful in the future. For example high schools, and colleges look at your community service hours and there is a greater percentage that you may get in that school. If they know that you are helpful to others, they would know that you would be helpful in their school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, community service is an amazing way to give others an idea of how much SCHOOL_NAME is an amazing school. If people see that SCHOOL_NAME students are helpful, and aware of the planet we live in, they would consider putting there child in our school. Not only would it make people consider this, but it would also leave a good reputation on our school and how it is run.\n",

      "I think you should make students perform community service for their own good. Community service will help the student for their education also to help them get in to college. For example my sister took community service for high school and that helped her to get good grades for high school and now she's attending SCHOOL_NAME.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, community service is not a waste of time, it might be for other but for my opinion its not a waste of time, its actually a very important time for our goal and education. Cleaning up litter is very important to keep our state very clean and neat to show others we can keep everything nice and in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Litter is very bad for our state like we need to keep away trash from our oceans to not provide the ocean animals to get killed or sick for some trash we had to cause. Another important thing is that its good that tutors help us get good education.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I think students should take community service for their own good and their future in life. People may think its a waste of time but it isn't at all. I learned this from my older sister doing her community in service during school and now she is getting her currier and doing good job at her University.\n",

For instance , doing community service involves doing lots of things like picking up trash so that the environment can be more cleaner , Help recycle so we don't have to kill things like trees and forest , and even going to the nursery homes and showing the elders that they have not been forgotten . Not doing community service is like letting bad people escape from jail , it make the world a less comfortable and even harder place to live in !\n",

      "You know you have heard what kids have been saying right, about if we should be required to do community service or not? Well I have friends that support both sides of the issue, and they are constantly bickering at one another, and is just want that to stop. So before you read this letter think to yourself, should i make kids do community service ? Well after you read this letter, your decision will most likely be yes, i should make kids do community service.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I stated up top, i think you should make us do community service, even if we don't want to. One reason why you should make us do community service is so that we know kind of what we want to be when we grow up. By doing community service, it opens up opportunities, and different choices that we never knew we had. So say someone has their mind set on being a professional athlete, but then gets the urge to be a firefighter? Then he can do community service to see if that urge to be a firefighter was a legitimate idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing community service also builds a person's character. I say this because what if someone was mistreated all of there life, wrong place at the wrong time, you know what I mean. So community service lets those type of people get away from their life, and help other people's, thus resulting in building character, and thus further resulting in a changed person for the rest of their life\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I am for making kids do community service. I am for this for a few reasons. My first reason for this is to make kids figure out what path they are going to be headed down in life, and maybe even change that path to a better one. Another reason is that community service builds character, and it can also result in the changing of somebody's whole entire life. So after you read this letter, I hope you can see deep down inside your heart that making kids do community service is only a good thing. And I am sick and tired of hearing my friends argue all the time. So if you are going to make a decision, I think almost everyone at are school would hope that you would make a decision sooner rather than later. So i guess also see you at school Mr. Principal.\n",

      "My parents taught me to respect and appreciate all that I have, and personally I don't think some of the students here at SCHOOL_NAME, appreciate what they have. To tell you the truth myself and people my age or older, always want something more than what they already have. Over the past year or so, I've learned how blessed I am just to have a family and a house, or even food to eat { and a variety of it}. I used to just want every little thing I saw in the store, or on\n",

      "TV, or even what my friends had. But truthfully, it really doesn't matter if you so called rock polo, or Abercrombie, or Hollister. Some people I know are like that and that really disturbs me, how people live based on what others say or do. That's just being trifling. I've also realized that I can't care about how people say I look, etc. , because beauty's only skin deep. Sometimes, some people really do want to help people but their constantly worrying about what their friends are going to think. If students were forced to do community service they may not personally like it, but it would change their way of thinking , and teach them to appreciate what they have. My grandmother is currently sick in a nursing physility, and I used to hate hanging around the elderly, but I see now, how it is to have someone you love not be able to wash themselves up, etc. But visiting my grandmother in the nursing home, makes me wake up everyday and think about how I have the active use of my limbs, and don't have to have someone help me get dressed and everything. Every time, I think about it, it just makes me even more grateful for what I have. This experience is also helping me learn about the elderly, and want to spend time with my grandmother. Even though she can't remember things anymore {because of dimmensia} , I sit and talk to her to let her know that I care, and whatever she has to say, even if it takes all day I'm always listening. It hurts me knowing that she's in the nursing home dying of cancer, but I'm truly proud of my mom going to take care of her everyday.\n",

      "\"Students , i would like for you to tell our principal why its is important for us to perform community service , do next class\" . Hmm community service ? well i think that it is important because if people litter eventually out earth is going to be a total mess and the WILL be garbage everywhere , it would be a great task to do after school or on free time and importantly if you would be helping a student our education progress will most likely go up like fire works at the park on fourth of July . I f your still not convinced let me explain my self better .\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with , i think i strongly agree for us students to be required to do community service because we are the kids from the future and our earth will become a total dump . I mean kids do have the strength to go around when the have free time and pick up trash for a local park or maybe as a class field trip go to the beach and pick up all the nasty litter people leave their it would be a win , win situation because in out win we will have a progress to a better earth and better place to live and the other win would have to do with the animals out in the ocean , the would also have ea better home and a cleaner place to live . The already going threw an oil spill i honestly don't think the need any more thing in their water . For an example think to yours self would you like to live in water and other people come and just throw things in your 'home' ? didn't think so , neither do i and neither do they .\n",

      "Students can do something productive with their time and make our earth a better place and even maybe have fun with community service it only for our goods . Its not like your doing it for a bad cause . I also think it will educate us not to litter and treat our world better then we do now .\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand i think making us students do community service because if the high school students or maybe middle school student decide to tutor elementary , the education will MOST LIKELY make progress . This is also a win , win situation because the high school/ middle school student would be able to get their minds refreshed with what the learned a couple years back and the other win would be the student from elementary would be getting help and will make progress with their academics . I know that parents will be coming to you saying \"wow , SCHOOL_NAME has an amazing principal and teachers cause they know how to really help my son/daughter \" and wouldn't that be nice ? thought so .\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all i think the our principal should really think about our school doing community service because our word WILL become a total dump if kids of the futures don't put their foot down and start to cleaning our earth with community service and it is a good activity to do after school or in free time and not become couch potatoes and if students decide to tutor the education progress and the grade of our younger student will increase . Now i would like to know , don't you think it would be an awesome idea to have us do community service ?\n",

It may take time out of their lives, (not that many middle school students have \"lives\" out of school anyways) but it's something that should be done not only for the community but for themselves. Required community service would defiantly be a good addition to our school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not every student has the resources or community ties to do community service. Requiring it would give those students the opportunity and level to do so. I for one wouldn't know where to start doing community service unless it was a class organized event. For example, if you required community service then, as a class, we could come up with ideas so we could all go and do our part to help the community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing community service takes time, yes, but it helps you out in the long run. Not only are you helping the community, but your also putting an advantage on your college applications. For example, say you were the Dean of Admissions at a college, and you had to choose between two students to accept. Which one would you choose, the one with community service, or the one with nothing? It also gives you this feeling of being needed and makes you a better person inside. I have felt unwanted and useless for a good portion of my life, but when I help someone else, it gives me hope and a joyous feeling to where I feel accepted and needed.\n",

      "Dear TEACHER_NAME, yes i think that all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME should attend in this community service. I think so because if all of the students attend in this we all could be able to clean up to help each and other and maybe help the teachers clean up in their rooms or just help people in the clean up after school. I know i' m one the students that doesn't like working or working for someone but i want to help our community keep our world a better place. Like for an ex: I'm walking down the hall way and i see paper fall and i pick it up, or i see someone in the hall way and someone drops their books i can stop and help them pick it up. That will make you and that person feel good inside and even make you feel good. It will you feel like you want to help other people. IF someone is crying or need someone to talk to your rite there to talk to them, to let them say what bringing them down or something they had on their mind all day and they want to tell someone but they cant because no one wants to hear what have to say. That's another way that you can help someone too. Now if non of the students don't participate in the community service thing then we will have a very bad school, or a bad location to live at because no one helps each other. They will always be fights and arguments because nobody cares about anybody's feelings. Doing this may take up my time but it is worth helping people and our community. Maybe in my older years i could come back down to the 8th or maybe the 1st grade and tell the kids how my life was when i was in there grade, and how i wouldn't listen or talk back to the teachers and stuff like that but when get older you will realize that all that could of been better. Like that wasn't me like i could be better and i can bring my grades up and listen to my teachers when they talk to me.\n",

      "Dear TEACHER_NAME, community service for middle school children is a very controversial issue some people say you should require it some say you shouldn't. You shouldn't require the kids of SCHOOL_NAME to do community service. In SCHOOL_NAME they will have to do community service anyways so why not let them have more time to do activities and projects with their parents and friends now. Community service is a great way to keep kids occupied and out of trouble. However the kids of SCHOOL_NAME don't get in trouble very much so this is not required. you could issue it as a punishment to kids that misbehave repetitively to keep them out of trouble. One may argue that community service is good for the kids. However they will have to do thirty hours of community service to graduate SCHOOL_NAME so they will be getting this experience in SCHOOL_NAME. One may argue that it would be good exercise to have kids cleaning up the town. However do you really want little fifth graders roaming around where they could be offered a ride home by a man in a white van and never seen again. This is the problem with younger kids cleaning up the town but if it was a High School student than they would be a lot smarter about what to do in situations like this. So TEACHER_NAME when deciding whether to have your Middle School kids say nay to requiring them to do community service. Save them from possibly being kidnapped.\n",

While some students already have community hours and some don't, I think that we should be required to have community service hours. Some many say It takes up my time, or i don't have time to do anything for the community, but i think that that's just a excuse. If all students in the school had at least two hours of community service i think that our community would be a little better. While some kids already have done things for the community like volunteer at schools, fire stations, neighbors or just cleaning up the trash around your neighborhood, others think that\n",

      "I also think that it would be a great idea at our school if we make a group of students and get together twice a week and go clean up around the school or around the neighborhood.

      "I do not think that you should make all students perform community service it should be a optional thing. The reason it is optional is because some people just don't have the time. Take me for example i have to go home after school grab a quick bite to eat then i have to go play basketball or go to the gym. I used to even have to babysit. Other kids also have this problem that they don't have enough time to do any of this because of babysitting a lot of kids in our school have little brother and/or sisters and have to babysit after school. Witch makes it impossible to go do community service because by the time our parents get home we have to eat dinner then go do our homework and its already night time. Also it should be optional because some people just don't care about community service. Like when i say this i mean it nicely but i don't care about community service in my neighborhood all it is to me is more work and responsibilities i have to do. I would much rather hang out with my friends everyday and have a very fun athletic and social life. Then to go to community service everyday and just work. I know how bad it sucks to have community service because when i had to do 150 hours of it for court i hated it. I had to get up in the morning on my weekends and go work for hours and i get nothing out of it but some trash picked up off the ground witch wouldn't bother me even if it was there. So giving kids requirements to do community service would not be fair, but there is kids out there that for some odd reason like to do this so i think you should just have a sign up sheet and hold meetings about coming to community service on certain days to help out the community once in a while and the kids that want to help can help and the kids that have things to do and have plans to hang out with people and sleep out or have someone sleep in should not have to do it if they do not want to. I also think that if kids do sign up you can like bring them on a trip or two and have special meetings with them in school were they can get out of class like once or twice a month to just go eat like pizza or ice cream or even just to hang out and talk while using our phones and ipods. The reason i say this is because you will get more kids to sign up like the kids like me who will do it just to get out of class and socialize more because we are always finding newer and better ways to socialize and not get in trouble. Plus why not reward us for wanting to help out the community and for helping out the school and all the other people in the community. But no matter what community service should never be force on a kid for school it should only be forced on when they get in trouble with the law but i don't think even then but that will never change so it don't matter. so please do not make us all have community service just have a sign up sheet and the people who come can get special rewards and treats other students don't get.\n",

      "Dear principal, personally, i don't think community service should be required, because if its not your thing your not going to want to do it and your not going to have fun doing it. I don't think it is much fun to do but i do it with my church anyways. This year a am going to go down to LOCATION_NAME and i am going to help with community service things we well be doing is helping hand out food and helping plant and things people cant do by themselves. I have a lot of friends that do cool stuff like that too. But if you require it makes it sound more like homework, and then kids wont be so excited about it. I think community service is about volunteering, if you want to volunteer and help out the community you should. Another trip i' m doing this year or next is going to my sister church in Mexico and helping them out with a group from my church. Some kids don't have enough time there either to busy with sports or x box or something but they should still make some time to volunteer, even if its not huge, they could collect food for a food bank or something small. that's what i think about requiring community service.\n",

The reason I wanted to tell you about this is because I understand that some students would like to do community service and not others. In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. If the students that want to do community service can do that. If there is only a small group of people than it would not be a good way to have the work done. Please consider this and if you don't like this than it will be fine to me. My other reason is not everyone would like to pick up liter. It might not be what students want to do during there free time. I understand that your the principal of this school and not every principal would consider this opinion because you believe that everyone should do community service. I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service and I also like to tell you that there should be a list of places that there going to do service at.\n",

      "I strongly believe that students should not be required to perform community service because students may have no time on their hands to fit in community service. Also kids might have after school activities. Lastly that might put them behind on their school work .Yes it could teach them responsibility but it also could affect them in a negative way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like kids might not have enough time on their hands to fit in community service. Like say they get detention from a teacher or have after school responsibilities from their parents. For example picking up a sibling or cleaning their room. If they have community service that might affect this and nothing will get done. Also they won't make it to community service and have to make up the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kids might have after school activities like football, dance or baseball. If kids have community service after school they might miss their sport or be late and have to sit out and watch. This can result in the kids not knowing whats going on in the sport and their coaches sitting them out during a game. For example if somebody takes dance after school he or she might not be able to participate in the performance because of community service. Also i would be a waste of parents money if they are paying for their child to play a sport and not being able to go because of community service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly it might put kids behind in their school work like not handing in extra credit or doing homework. For example if kids have to go to a community service after school, be late to their activity then go home and start your homework. Kids would get tired and not want to do homework. Also i don't think kids should have to juggle all these responsibilities at this age! I believe that community service should only take place when a child is disobedeant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion kids should not have to take community service after school. It might cause the students grades to lower, not participating in after school activities or some kids might not have enough time to fit in community service. Thank you.\n",

Yes there are some reasons that might be helpful but students that love sports shouldn't have to be anything less that what is expected of them. The policy should remain the same because some kids that are very talented in sports more than others, may struggle in just one specific class. Most students that have a B average are not participating in sports at our school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many high school and middle school students struggle in the some of the same classes such as Math, History/Social Studies, English, Science/Biology/Chemistry. These are all tough classes but could be more difficult for students in different areas of the subject. For example, if our high school football team is going to the championships and our star player/quarter back has an 85% in Biology and is turning in a minor paper due 2 days before game time, and the teacher grades it as a C. This student with an 85% in that class has a B right now but if them get a C on a minor paper there grade could drop to somewhere in the low 80's or high 70's which no longer is considered a B average. Your star player and quarter back is out for the game and possible risk loosing the championship all because of one small paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many clubs out there for students to join and have fun in, but more than likely half the students in those clubs don't play sports and have at least a B average. Think of all the kids that aren't in those clubs that do play sports and are just short of a B average. People with an A average like you participate in Science Olympiad, Book clubs, and math clubs. But others who play Volleyball, Cross Country, Basketball, Wrestling, Track, Softball, Swimming and so on may not be capable of being in those clubs due to class grades. If you change the policy and make it so only people with a B average can play sports then you might be cutting out half of the school from your sport programs.\n",

That group of students that love being in sports includes me. I participate in cheer leading, volleyball, and soccer.

I also believe that if the sports team should have at least a B so should the cheer leaders, dancers, book clubs and any other organizations in this wonderful school. I think that if people want to be in originations in this school that they must have there work turned in and get school first because that when they start sports it will take out time they might usually use for studying.

      "I realize that you are considering changing the school policy so that student cannot participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average. And kids with C averages shouldn't be able to play sports or other curricular activities unless they get there grades up. I want to let you know that I fully agree with this thought. I do believe that grades should be the main priority, and other activities should fall in second. If you let C average students participate in unnecessary events, there grades would drop even more because there to focused on those activities and not enough on their school work. So all of those C average students would be future D or F average students. This wouldn't be a good look for our school.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a bright side to this policy believe it or not. Some students actually enjoy and have a strong love for sports and extra activities. If C average students realized they could not be involved with these activities, they would want to do something about it. This would make strive harder to get there grades up. So your C average students would become B or even A average students. This would increase the passing rate of our school statics and make SCHOOL_NAME look very good. So Principal TEACHER_NAME when it comes down to the day where you have to make you decision, I hope you consider these thoughts. And look at all the disadvantages and advantages. But overall I hope you make the right decision for our school.\n",

      "I think that the new policy on grades and sports is a great idea. Many students have a hard time at keeping their grades up while playing school activities. The new policy of having to have a B average to play is a great idea. There are many kids that have a C or lower average in one or more classes. To be good at sports I also think you should have good grades. To be able to get into a good college you must have good grades. So I think it is very important that kids keep B and A averages throughout grade school. If you are taking on the responsibility to play a school sport, you should be responsible to do all your school work and to try to get good grades. The new policy is a great way to keep kids focused on school. If the students really want to play a sport they will try harder and all their grades will go up and they can participate in school activities. In conclusion, I think the new policy for sports is a great idea.\n",

      "Schoolwork should always comes first in life so that our society may thrive on the next generation of adults. Not only does that affect our future as a country, but the children's future as athletes. As a student at this school, I agree 100% with the policy change. Students need to learn not to procrastinate, to finish their work on time and perfect, and also to respect the help from adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "Procrastination is the worst possible thing, next to the number of detentions, that this school has. Students on sports teams have stated that they \"have no time to complete the assignment\" or \"the game went into overtime.\" The students of SCHOOL_NAME need to learn how to get things done in an efficient way in order to have time for sports. The only way that the students are to learn the concept of no procrastination is to have the parents to make sure it gets done. I do not think it matters what method the parents choose, I only want to see more and more kids showing up and playing sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students are completing their homework though, but the finished product is very sloppy. Another one of the problems is that students rush through their homework and hope that the teacher will give them an A so they may play in the game after school. The only problem with this is that students just do not want to take the time to check their work and actually learn the concept. This in fact does affect the students' grades. Test grades go way down, and the homework scores go down as well all because of the time it took for the student to complete the assignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teachers generally spend almost half the class time going over an assignment that the class will do for homework that night. The third problem is just that. Teachers spend almost the whole day helping students prepare for the test, homework, or just studying and the sports playing students usually throw all of that time in the trash. They just do not want to respect the help that all the adults at school and home give them. I believe that they just want to help themselves get to where they want to be, which we both know, are the sports fields. We should probably not interfere, but considering the lowering of this school GPA, we need to do something.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not me to tell an adult what to do, but I will tell you something. Not only is the school suffering from the bad choices such as procrastination, not creating quality work, and not using all of the help that adults have given them, but the future generations to come are at stake if we do not give this generation's children a good education. This policy must be enforced, or risk a de-progression into the cavemen eras.\n",

The reason some of the scholars here at SCHOOL_NAME strive to make C' s on their report cards is so that they can participate in sports.

Not only would this motivate people to get their grades higher but it would also serve the experimental propose of seeing weather or not kids have to have a \"prize\" in order to increase their grades in school. I personally don't play much sports so this wouldn't effect me but I know of others who would be devastated by this new rule.\n",

      "If this rule were to be in effect than I think many students would revolt at the idea especially in SCHOOL_NAME where most of the sport stars don't have the best marks. I think that this rule wouldn't really help anyone I mean people should want to get their grades up for themselves not because they want to play sports. I would have to disagree with this rule because it really favors no one and some people who get to play sports or do whatever they like in school enjoy school more and are motivated to excel.\n",

Without being able to participate in sports they are going to turn to other things, and it's not going to be homework.\n",

      "Sports play a vital role in student's lives whether they have an A average, a B average, or a C average. Grades are very important but so are sports. Kids my fellow students still need to be active no matter what. Without sports to do kids who are having problems at home or problems with their grades use sports as an outlet. It is something they can enjoy doing and helps them feel better. Why would you want to take that away from them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Without sports students are going to start turning to something else. Drugs. Without sports as their outlet they need a new one and they are going to start hanging around the wrong kids.

      "You are the one who is always saying \"Stay active\" \"Don't do drugs\". By enforcing this new policy you are basically encouraging the opposite of those phrases. The kids who have a C average aren't going to be able to do sports and will find drugs as another outlet. So instead of trying to make things better by encouraging people to get their grades up so that they can do sports, your creating the opposite effect and making things much worse.\n",

I think that you should have the audacity to tell everyone that the sports will not be able to be played by students that have anything below an A-C average. All student with an A, B, or a C average can play any sport they wanted to but every marking period they should have to show the coach's their progress report. All students should be able to show their progress reports to you, a teacher, or the coach. An other reason not to cancel the sports are so that all the students can stay in shape and not have any troubles with their weight.

This will motivate the students to do better in school, give them something positive to look forward to, and it would make the school look better.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the students are required to have a B average this will motivate them to better in school. If they want to participate in sports and other activities, they will do better in school. In general, if a person really wants something, they will be willing to work for it. In this case, the students will be forced to keep watch on their grades. This will in turn give them a noticeable reward for their hard work.\n",

      "This will also give students something positive to look forward to. 35% of all American students have negative influences around them when they leave school.

Well as of now 45% of our students are failing at least 3 classes, and a recent survey shows that 95% of SCHOOL_NAME students like to play a sport and enjoy the activities held after school. If you require them to have a B average, they will get better grades in order to do what they want to do.\n",

I believe that doing sports helps a student get better grades, as they have a drive to continue, so as not to get kicked off their team.

      "As a student at SCHOOL_NAME, I would like to say that the grade average to play in sports is much too unfair. many students who like to play sports have grade C average in their grades and we would lose more than half of the players on the sports teams. Therefore giving an unfair advantage to the other team. Now I think that we should at least keep the grade requirement to be a C average that way those who have a C average can stay on the team. Having the grade changed to a B average will not only frustrate students, but parents too. If parents are frustrated with the change then no one will be happy because you will get calls of frustration and the kids will be frustrated and have even more focus on the sport and not on school work. Trust me, take this from a kid who had been kicked off of the sports team because of bad grades. The grade requirement should be a C average and not a B average.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree one hundred percent that students should have equal balance between school work and sports. That is one of the many things college applicants look for when they choose who will go to the college of their choice. But is it really fair to make the students who have good grades be out numbered by the students on the other team who have bad grades? I think not. A C average would be much easier on the students because then we would have a fair play against other schools instead of being the only school who's grade average for sports is a B. This is also very frustrating for the parent to have to find out what they are going to do for getting their kid home at three o' clock when they are working and don't have any spare keys to the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we have a C average then it will be easier for kids to keep their grades up because they will be scared to keep their grade at a C or below. since they want to keep playing and not have to worry about school work too much. It would also help to have more time for sports. like optional practice. If the athlete knows their parents are going to be a while coming to pick them up they should have the option to stay and practice after practice is through. Like an open gym kind of. I think this would be a great experience for the athlete and the parents.\n",

There are a few students that have A' s and B' s but a few is not enough to make up a full football team or basketball team so if you change that policy you would be taking away that joy of our team winning a basket ball game or foot ball game. Sure athletes could play outside of school but then there would be no reason for winning because it doesn't go towards a reputation or anything. I think that many other kids would agree with my side of this argument because its something that we can all do with friends and meet other people from other schools.

Cutting back on sports and raising the grade point average is causeing obesity in teens all across America would you really want to be hated by over half the schools population.

      "I think your new plan to keep kids from playing sports or other extracurricular activities is outrages. Kids like myself play sports and other activities ti find a way our of the daily stress of school and social drama might i add. It is ridiculous that you should withhold things that we cherish the most in order for us to have to take on more work then what is usually some of us may have learning disabilities or we do the work and the teacher doesn't answer our questions in class to the full extent. Have you thought of an alternative then just take away our escape from reality these activities are keeping us from running the streets like a bunch of hood rats and hoodlums.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you should think of an alternative then just to take away what our means of therapy is maybe one day out of the week we could not practice and just do a study hall. Or you may just sit us out for a game or the 1st quater/first half to motivate us to do better and achieve better in ourselves. Some of us may just be to depressed or mad to simply just try to bring up our grades if we cant ensure that we will play.\n",

      "Would you please consider to let students play sports unless they are failing two classes? many of my fellow class mates will feel very strongly against your decision if you do not at least consider what I am about to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, most of the students at this school have a C average. Next, if only students with a B average can participate in sports, many students with a C- average would feel discouraged and give up before even trying. Some people in Algebra 1 have a c+ average because the work is substantially harder than Algebra A. Also since most of the students in the school have C averages than there wouldn't be that many people to try out for sports teams. Most of the students who have an A-B average are not very good at sports and therefore they don't even try out for sports teams. If they did try out than your team will mostly consist of scrubs. If there are only scrubs on your team than schools like SCHOOL_NAME and SCHOOL_NAME would murder them, and you wouldn't get any more trophies for the rest of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since most of the students have C averages, they wouldn't get put on the team, and thus they probably wouldn't make their high school team because over the Summer they would have had to start all over in their training because their muscles have forgotten how to play the sport like: swimming, basketball, baseball, and etc you have to continually practice in order to get better at it and in some states you can't practice them all year round so the only time they get to play them is for their school teams.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many students at SCHOOL_NAME tend to focus more on sports than they do on their own school work. I witness it myself; kids are talking about the weekend's football game rather than what our teacher is trying to teach us. Since they care so much about their extracurricular activities/sports, they often get C's in most classes instead of A's and/or B's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raising the grade average for sports really encourages kids to focus on school work, and realize that school should be one of their top priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keeping a B grade average is actually quite simple, but many students think that it would be a lot easier to focus solely on sports activities rather than to juggle both school and sports. What a distorted view, right? Sports teams require commitment, and commitment can be messed up when kids are stuck in detention, retaking a previously failed test, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, kids in this school don't realize that sports are a privilege and a luxury rather than just a regular activity for their school. Students shouldn't be allowed to participate in sports if they can't have self-control and say, \"I think I'll skip practice today and work on homework/study instead.\"\n",

      "People make mistakes, and you changing the average would be a big one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know a lot of cheerleaders and basketball players, who barely pass to stay in their sport, but when they're on that court, or on that field, etc, they look as happy as can be and they do a great job.\n",

Middle school is tough, yes we should try our best and some of us do and we still have a C average or lower. i wouldn't say a D or F average for sports but, at least a high C average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, i disagree with her because some of our football and basketball players dedicate there life to there sports, and are really good at them! If our best football player is struggling with a C average, are you just going to shut him out of playing football? Then you know he's going to be upset and most likely switch schools if he can. SCHOOL_NAME doesn't need to loose any great kid, we have some of the best football players and need to keep them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last i disagree with her because people would complain, coaches, and parents. some of our coaches love there players absolutely love there players, and i' m sure that would be a big disappointment to loose them out on the field or court. Parents would complain im sure of because you should see some parents at the games, they really get into it! Sports really take control of some peoples life's and they become a part of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion i disagree with her because, some of our best athletes have trouble keeping there grades up, some of our football and basketball players dedicate there life to there sports, and also because people would complain.\n",

      "Dear TEACHER_NAME, i would like to talk to you about the sports grades and for other activities. I dislike it because i can't get up to a \"B\" average in some of my classes, and also most kids have great talents here , and should be able to have a chance to prove it with at least a high \"C\" also we should not have to have at least a \"B\" to participate in other school activities like games , or fun razors , or school rally's that should be something that should be fun for every student to enjoy and go to.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, In my classes i struggle to get things done and to make good grades. I can't pass every test and if i fail one it lowers my grade big time. You should not count every grade on us because , not every one has learning ability like other students in the building every student should get there own shot at a sport and the coach should help them out with there grades , like say they could have a study hall to help their players , or they could bench them until they brought it up i' m sure every student would want to play so they would be determined to bring it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, most of the student here have wonderful outstanding talents and should be able to prove that. If you made us have to have good grades i' m positive our school would not have good sports team and probley not enough players to play a game. I would suggest that if you want to change the grades that you should change it to a very high \"C\" or we won't have good teams at our school and you would probley loose some good students that we need. Some students don't understand there work and can't learn as quickly as other students can. I am not saying you should not push them to do there hardest , i' m just saying that everyone deserves a chance at something , and should be given that chance to prove what they got.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, if you take away school activities to kids who have a \"C\" average then that's a little low don't you think ??? All kids should be able to go to anything that has to do with school and having fun if they have a \"C\"\n",
      "\n",
      "average if you ask me. If we had a fun razors and you said kids with c' s could not come , and they watched all them other SCHOOL_NAME students with good grades have fun don't you think that's a little harsh? I think all kids should get to have fun also you should never leave a student out if they try there hardest to succeed in their homework and daily school work. This doesn't mean that if a student is the worst kid that don' t mean he should be able to go of course he shouldn't have the ability to do any of the fun in school, all kids should have fun in school activities and not have to worry about a \"C\" and getting kicked off the team or not going to a field trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, most kids do honestly try there hardest to do what they can in school and should not ever be punished or talked to about a \"C\" average. Every kid does try and works hard and should not ever have to worry about some one telling them that they are kicked off the team and can't go on the trip or go to this dance because of it that would hurt there feeling and a lot of parents would be at the school complaining to you about it. A lot of kids have different subjects their good in and the subjects that they are not the best in, so you should not be hard on them or the might drop all the grades and just stop trying, and not like school and never want to go back because there teachers told them that their best is not good enough. So if you want to have some trouble with parents my advice to you is don't change anything.\n",

      "Hello TEACHER_NAME this is STUDENT_NAME. This is very unfair to all of the students who go to SCHOOL_NAME. Students who want to participate in activities or sports should at least have a C average or at least a C+ average. There is nothing wrong having at least a B average but the minimum should be a C. I play basketball and also my brother does too. My brother goes to high school so i should know this. In order to do any activities your grades should be a C so making it a B is unfair. And what is really unfair is that if the boy or girl is really good at sports, and is bad at his or her academics. This is really upsetting for the parent and the child. And you know what is really upsetting part is, if the boy or girl wants to be that in his or her life. So TEACHER_NAME I hope after reading this letter that you would not change the school policy to a B average.\n",

Now, say that you are in there shoes would you like that to happen to you i don't think so, as you can see I failed the first grade i hated that and i lost my confidence in my self i felt like i cant do nothing about it I even felt alone so as a student of SCHOOL_NAME i know what its like to struggle through school i still do right now I have low grades but\n",

I am writing you this letter because I want to give my opinion about letting the average of students grades to be a B in order to play sports. In this letter I am going to how changing the average of students grades to B, it will keep kids more educated, it will help the school be a smarter school, and will give kids a punishment if they don't have an average of a B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students will be more educated by having more time to do homework then play ball. Lots of kids who play sports take more of their time practicing then doing school work. For example I play soccer at SCHOOL_NAME it takes a lot of time out of my day but I still enjoy it. I have straight A' s too. Student that don't make the team will have more time to study for a test or do homework. They may even make better grades then the people that are in sports which is great.\n",
      "\n",
      "SCHOOL_NAME will be a smarter school by changing the grade policy to a B average. Instead of the kids making bad grades that are in sports they can be making good grades out of sports. we will have more smart kids in our school instead of good athletic teams. i know that these is a big change in our school but I think we can do it.\n",

      "As our school policy is now we have to have a 76% or above in all your classes in order to participate in school sports such as basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, track. We have some students in our school who are very good in many sports but are not as good in school, so they don't have very good grades. Many of us at our school think that students should have at least a 70% or above to play sports , because if you have it at a B grade average not very m any students will be playing sports because not that many students are able to keep there grades up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students love to play sports it keeps them entertained and out of trouble out side of school grounds, but not very many students who are very well at sports are not able to play because they can not keep their grade average up to a B average. Although many think that it is good for a student to have a B average in all their classes others disagree. Others disagree because not everyone is the smartest and doesn't do the greatest in their classes, so they are not able to play any sports, and therefore they get themselves in to trouble.\n",

      "Recently many students have heard about the change that you are thinking to make towards the school's sports program. Statistics in our school show that students here have at least a C average grade. The change of making the average needed to participate in sports programs is a B average grade. The following parts to this letter explain why we should keep it at a C average grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, many students at SCHOOL_NAME do good jobs keeping there grades up. Yet there still are students who don't care about their grades, or at least don't try to get good grades.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a C grade counts as a passing grade. Some students who may have a C still are achieving the needed goals in their classes. Another example is, if a child is having trouble keeping their average grade at a B, the students should at least be given something to fall back on, if their grades aren't perfect. lastly, the final reason why this change should not be made is because, students who participate in sports have something to look forward to. If they are not able to participate in lets say club volleyball, or club soccer, they at least have a resource that helps them have a chance to play a sport they love if that sport is provided by the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, SCHOOL_NAME has many students who like to play sports, and exercise. Changing this policy may jeopardize the chance for these students to participate in the sport they play. Another reason that I would like to ask you to keep a C average is, students at SCHOOL_NAME know that you have to keep your grades up to qualify for sports, or even other chances for you to participate in school activities. Lastly, we students, like to do things outside of school as well as in school. By saying this, I mean that students should be able to participate in school sports or activities if they have any passing grade average.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, students or parents may believe that changing this policy may help our school achieve higher test scores. This would be due to the effort students would have to put into studying for tests or even just for their homework. Another example is , parents may not want students to play sports with a C average grade, because that means that the student is barely passing. Of course as any parent would want there child to succeed in classes, so they can have better opportunities in their years of continuing middle school or even moving into high school . Lastly, a parent may want his or her child to continue with high grades, not just barely passing, but just completely passing. They may believe that sports may get in the way of the students studying or homework time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I appreciate the time you took to read this letter. I would also like to thank you for your time in taking our opinions into consideration. So now you know a few reasons why students would like the average grade to stay a C, compared to why the parents believe that a B average may be a better choice. Thank you once again.\n",

The students want to be able to participate in sports and activities because it lets them be free and cope with problems they might have at the time. They might have problems running or jumping so they join the soccer team to help with running. The students could also be trying very hard to get a C but barely make it. If you change the requirements for after school activities then they wont be able to participate because they can barely make a C. Many students would not be able to participate with the activities because of their grades so the people directing the activities might loose their job because of the lack of participating students.

      "I don't think your ideas on the grade B average are completely acceptable for the following reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "For one, I, as a tennis player, and a musician, for SCHOOL_NAME, wouldn't like this. I take both my education and extracurricular activities very seriously. I try to thrive and prosper in everything that I'm out up to, or chose to do. I believe I'm probably not the only student who feels this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about the students who struggle at something, but give it everything they have at it? What if they also love their extracurricular activities? I think we should find other methods of developing their academic skills other than taking away something they love to do. If you did take that away from them, they'd have a sense of disappointment in themselves even when they gave it everything they have, and this is definitely not a good thing for students to feel. It could make them depressed and upset their character.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also another side to the story however.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to do about the students who don't give academics their all? Well, this is a difficult decision. We can find other ways and give our best to help them feel like they should care about what they do at school in the academic field. Tutorials or any other activities to improve their outlooks on these issues, but not take away other classes that improve other skills they may like participating in. This could also bring students to the level of a B average you are expecting from them if they get all the necessary help they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about our school motto, \"Winning is a habit\"? Yes, winning is a great thing, but your a winner if you give 110% and you know that you did the very best you could, yet there's always room for improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I believe this would be too much of a blow to the students at SCHOOL_NAME. I may not be having issues in my academics, nor my extracurricular activities, but I speak on behalf of my schoolmates when I share my thoughts and opinions on this situation.\n",

      "I am informed of your new policy change. I understand your views and though I understand academics are important, students need encouragement, recreation, and the opportunity to be well rounded and I find these things are in extra curricular activities and sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to your consideration of this new policy it would be harsh on the children and director of the certain activity. By making this rule, I feel as if the students would be lacking the circumstances they need besides academics. Extra curricular activities enrich the mind, community, and body. Taking these things away from the children gives them nothing to look forward to after school, and keeps the school stress bundled up inside of them. Sports and clubs encourage students to relieve their stress, make friends, and become active in their community. So if a certain student really struggles, it would be discouraging and crush their self-esteem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students that struggle have a right to enjoy activities, and maybe there would be an alternative to keep kids in sports and clubs, yet also maintain their grades. Possibly, you could organize a study group or extra help sessions from teachers after school so that they can participate in their activities but also keep up the grades. Since a C average is an average grade for most student, it would put down their confidence as if you were saying they are below the average, which could hurt the student's feelings very much.\n",

      "My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. I agree with what you are doing to the school policy. An education is important for future life. It is more important than playing sports for your school. If a student wants to play sports, he should have at least a B- average. What happens if you end up getting kicked out of the sport and are forced to get a job. Most of the good paying jobs won't accept you without a certain degree whether it be bachelors or doctorates. You need the grades for the high paying jobs. Colleges usually review your grades before they let you play on their team and let you attend their college.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the student really wants to play on the school team, then s/he should be taking his/her grades and education seriously. Until s/he is in college that student should have to get at least B averages. Let him/her get on the team even if his/her grade is 3 points under a B, but make him/her get his/her grades up or s/he gets cut off the team. If s/he doesn't have a B average come the semi- championships/championship games, s/he gets benched. Even if s/he is the best player on the team. That way there is some incentive to keep the grades up- or get them up.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I believe you are doing the right thing by changing the school policy. Allow the student to play if s/he has at least a 77 grade average but make him/her get that grade up to an 80 average before the \"big game\". And you are probably thinking oh he is just a kid that doesn't play sports for the team. But the truth is I did run on the SCHOOL_NAME Track team so I know what those \"big games\" are like. When you get booted off the team- I didn't: my mom took me out because I didn't keep up with chores- it doesn't feel \"cool\". You think \"I could have helped the team win\" and you start feeling down or mad. Either way- this isn't a personal paper-\n",

      "Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that every student should have a c+ average because have that is easy for a lot of students but have to have a b average would be hard for a lot of people because many of us are passing by the skin of our teeth. I believe no they should not have to have a b average\n",
      "\n",
      "My first reason why is if you hade to have a b+ average a lot of students could not reach that so there would not be many kids participating in the school activities so if there where not a lot the teams would be un even (A lot would not have a varsity, JV team) So it would be pointless for many schools to even have sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the reasons is the average should not be in general it should be where your talking about because if you talking about inner city kids that don't have a lot to get for them self's like school work so it would be harder for them to keep up with the other schools and if you talking about higher end schools yes the average should be a b+ because they have everything they need to pass school and if they don't then its there fault for behind lazy at school\n",
      "\n",
      "My least but best reason is that the schools should be at a b+ average are proble the smaller schools because the ratio would be easier to have a b+ school when you only have 100 kids i go to SCHOOL_NAME and we have atleast 1000 kid's and it would be hard for the few people to try to keep the b+ average up.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my TEACHER_NAME i hope you see why i say No for the b+ average to be able to in sports. Thanks for taken the time to look over my reason and see why i picked no.\n",

      "As a student of SCHOOL_NAME, I disagree to have the new policy that students may not participate in sports or any other activities unless they have at least a B average grade. I disagree with this policy, because I think that many students work hard to get at least a B average, and maybe if the really love a sport and want to play in it then we should be fare and let them play. Because then I think it wouldn't be fare if a student is just one or two points away from a B average and then not let them play, just because of one low grade or two points off. So then if there are only a little bit of students with a B average then there would be no teams or sports because all of the kids would not be eligible, also in the school activities there wouldn't be many kids there so it wouldn't make the activities as fun. Although I do agree with you that if they do not have good grades and if they have to many U' s then they should not be eligible to play. Therefore if they really loved sports and wanted to play in them, then they would try to raise their grade for it. So I disagree about putting and changing this to become a school policy.\n",

      "I have been told that you wanted to change the policy on the grade students should have to play in sports (if you have a grade C average than you wouldn't be able to play) , and that you also wanted the students views on that. Well I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME and I know for the majority, most kids wouldn't think it fair if you went into action with this policy, and there are other reasons you shouldn't put this policy into action too, here are some of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason why you should put this policy into action is because if the majority of the students have a grade C average at your school, then SCHOOL_NAME would lose many team members, this policy might make you think it would encourage kids to have better grades, but it might affect the team for those who want to slack off, not even necessarily slack off because a grade C average isn't even failing. Unless you want the school's reputation to go down by losing many games because they have little members, than you could follow through with this policy. But I wouldn't encourage it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason why I wouldn't encourage putting this policy into action is because a grade C average isn't considered failing, and in most schools for activities they won't let you participate if you are failing, but it would be fine with them if you had a grade C average. Not that we are in competition or anything but I am sure SCHOOL_NAME wants to be represented as a good, cool, and fair school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also another reason could be because maybe a student has a grade average C in one of their elective classes, now that definitely wouldn't be fair if someone didn't get to do sports because they had a grade average C in an elective class. Electives are supposed to be a privilege, not something you should base whether they play sports or not. And the fact that they had a grade average C in that class and saying that they couldn't play sports wouldn't be fair because if they aren't even failing the class then they should have the right to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are a few reasons why you shouldn't tell kids they can't play sports if they a grade C average. Think these reasons over and thank you for the time being that you read this letter.\n",

      "This is STUDENT_NAME saying that i think it is ridiculous to change the sports policy to a C average. I have gotten support by this idea from many students who play sports for the school. I have done some studying on most of the student grades and most students at our school are making low C' s - high B' s. I don't think this new policy is fair because we will lose amazing players that make C+ average. It is possible that We will lose a lot of students on our campus as well. I think that we should at least discuss this issue with the students who participate with school sports. I have also taken study on other school websites and most of their sport requirements are high C' s. Most of us here at SCHOOL_NAME really do think that you are taking this to far. Even some of the teachers are agreeing on my input, they have all signed my partition on lowering the policy. Please TEACHER_NAME, except our agreement on what we students of SCHOOL_NAME say. It would really make myself, my peers and the teachers here very happy.\n",

      "I am in the 8th grade at SCHOOL_NAME. I just had to come to you about the new school policy. I don't like the way you change it because its so unfair to the people who try there best in class , but just cant understand the work. Why not let the people who have a C average in their class participate in their school sports. But I can understand if they didn't try to do any work n make a C average. There should be a way that the people with a C average get a chance to participate in different things in there school. Here are something u can do talk to the teacher bout giving make up work. Staying for the after school program. Having Saturday school for 5hours. So there are lots of things you can do by help the C average people get there grades up if that's what u are real trying to do , but it has nothing to do with participate in sports or other activities. Children just want to do stuff with there life so that they can stay out of trouble and become successful to help their family . So I just want to tell u what i think about this new school policy. Hope u have a lovely and bless day.\n",

If I was the coach i will see how all my player are doing and have they teacher give them a grade on the work every day. Then at practice if u got a bad grade you have to run the whole practice. So he will get a B average or u can't not play in the game or you can't practice. So i think he or she will get a B average to play. And one more thing you should have is good behavior in class. But at SCHOOL_NAME our mission is too get good grades and go for all A's. All sports should be like no grades no sports that what I think because all kids can do it. Your grades are first and sports is last. I play sports an I have to have a 2.5 to play sorts at SCHOOL_NAME.\n",

      "\n",
      "I strongly agree with the idea that students should not be playing sports with an C average.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know a C is passing but sports will drop our scores cause we are focusing more on sports than we are on raising our scores and that will only bring our scores down, and we wouldn't want that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn't matter if we are the best in the sport, we need to be the best in class also.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's why our coaches and teachers should work harder in getting our students here at SCHOOL_NAME better grades that will and I hope this will let people recognize us a more intelligent school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our school has many intelligent students, but they just don't show it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have students talking back to the teacher, fighting, disobeying the school policies, and many other bad things to make our school look, and most of them students play sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "These sport players are having problems with their grades and are doing things that they shouldn't be doing in class that's why most of them have an C average, and that's why you will see a most of our students in ISS (in school suspension), constantly in the main office, and in trouble all the time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Why i chose this because they are still passing they classes at a C and most schools says that if your passing by a chance of one C Did you could be on any sport team you want to . I could see if students have a C Form they first report card and they start bring down they grades than you could kick them off the sport they play .\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason why i chose this because C Is not a bad grade . Any C is not a bad grade unless you have A Low C and is bring your grade down to a D . Now if you have an High C Its a different story because your bring your grade up to a B Or and A like it should be .\n",
      "\n",

      "that's easy if your really paying close to the board and the teacher its nothing you could get your grades up like that . Also you always have to do your work and don't skip class , don't be late because you might miss something that was very important that you needed to know , but when you was late you needed to know what was the lesson and you don't know what it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also and when report cards come out and you see your grades and its a D or and F than you are going to be very unhappy with it . But it's really going to be on you because maybe you wasn't in class or you came late or sleep or didn't do your work like you was suppose to .\n",

If you bring up the grades the schools team sports will lose good team athletes that are half way decent in the class room, but are exceptional on the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes there are a majority of students that have B averages but even though they do the percent of them don't make up most of the teams. The teams have different people on them that work in different ways. Yes some kids and parents could argue that the athletes should be smart and well educated, but what they don't say is that the kids should have fun and do what they like to do. Students that can get a middle course grade (a, b, C, d and f) should be able to go out after school and have a fun, disciplined time with their coaches and team mates.\n",

      "School shouldn't become a place where students don't want to learn and it will become that way if you take away sports for most.

      "I am writing this letter to aware you of the changes you have made in the school policy. I see that you have made a change that no students are allowed to play sports unless they have a average of a B , which I think is a great policy mentally. Because I think students have a high C they should still be able to participate in school actives because no kid wants to sit out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that if students have a average of high C they should still be able to participate & also because students that have one C can be slacking off only in one class and I think that's acceptable. Not everyone does great in every class / subject. Also if students are really great at that sport we can be able to reward them with a scholarship. Like me I am a good student I have good grades the only class that I don't really great in is mathematics. I get a high which I think is acceptable.\n",

      "This new policy I may think is also regarding many parents of the children in the School. Some parents probably may go along with this rule. Yes because it is a good rule I think this policy is good but should also be to student with a high C average . Why? Because if students have a high C they are closely high to B which in that matter are eligible to participate in the school major activities. I say \"Major Activities\" because I think it should only be sports that are eligible for scholarships like for boys/girls Basketball, Baseball, Soccer , Track , Football and Cheer leading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if this a rule because the school board doesn't want to loose a lot of money which I would understand . But there is ways for a school to make money like having a fundraiser and also for the sports students can also go tagging like at the nearest food store . Ex. Shop rite,\n",

      "We the students of SCHOOL_NAME, would like to inform you that all students aren't able to make a \"B\". The reasons for that is that, if we fail a test or tests that can really drop our grade. And because by us being if sports will push up to keep our grade up in that sports, because that our desire and passion in what we like.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason is because, if we have a test and we fail that drops us from a \"B\" to a \"C\" already. And when we stress over trying to get that low \"C\" up to a \"B\" makes it even worst. Because some of the class might be hard. I'm not saying that keeping a \"A,B\" average is hard or impossible but not for us to try to maintain for sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "My other reason, is that by us being able to take part in school active is that, if we love a have a good feel for it then we will make sure that our grades are right. That we have nothing lower then a \"C\". Willing to do all our work, and will try hard to keep our grades up just to play in the game.\n",

      "I, as a student of this school, and a fellow athlete, think that it is completely un-fair for a student to maintain a B average to participate in any sports or any other activities. For some of the athletes we have at SCHOOL_NAME it is very hard for us to maintain a high average. Students here are completely satisfied with the fact that they have a passing grade, which in most cases is a C. One main reason we, students, do not like this policy change is because when we have say a Volleyball game coming up and our most valuable player cannot make it because she was making a 72 in Math class, this s not fair to the coaches, nor the players or the team. We want to set a good example for our school, but we can't do that without a valuable player. We want our school to be a great school in the eyes of the other school, but if we can't have any good games to show how hard our school works, we wont have anything to show for. Other school activities like the after school program. We play games and we have fun, but we can do that without finishing our work first, so in order to do that we have to have a passing average, our passing average now is a C, so if we change it now, we will have to work ten times harder to get that passing average for a B. We don't feel this is a comfortable situation. Our school loves the policy we have now, and we would love it if it stayed the same and didn't change. Our school has many great people here, and we don't want them to leave us for another school, because they get to maintain a C average over there.\n",

      "\"C\" average instead of a \"B\" average. This is so because, many students have a \"C\" average in middle school, this means that these students that are on the sports teams and do have \"C\" averages, would not be able to play if they had changed it to a \"B\" average in order to play on a sports team. A lot of students would be spending more of their time playing video games and watching TV instead of getting that out of school work outs that teenagers need. I know that most teachers and principles would think that if they are not on a sports teen then they are at home studying, but i am here to tell you that i am a middle school teenager as well and I would most definitely rather spend my time playing video games instead of studying and playing sports.

      "RELATIVE_NAME was a average student that had A' s B' s and a C. One day he was on his ways to basketball practice when his coach told him he couldn't play no more. Shocked RELATIVE_NAME asked him why? His coach said that he needed to get higher than a C to be able to play sports. The next day the school lost more than half of their sports players. That year SCHOOL_NAME couldn't participate in any games. Just like him there is other going through the same thing in school. That's why I think the principal should not require a B or higher to play sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first reason why I think that principal should not require a B or higher to play sports is that even if kids have a C they are trying. Its not fair for others who don't even care about it and decided to flunk. Just because of them their going to take a privilege away from everybody. He should just have a talk with the players of every sport. That way kids who don't want to be in it can get out and do better in school. Kids need to exercise daily. Having too much homework can prevent them from going outside and play. That why i think principal should not require a B or higher to play sports.\n",

      "Another reason is why I think principal should not require a B or higher to play sports is because kids need to learn how to work in teams. It can help them some how in their life. learning to get along with other people could lead them to a good future. For example if you're looking for a job and you get the one you like, but there is another person working with you that you didn't get along in school. You are not just going to quit your dream job. You can talk to them and solve the problem and you can work peacefully with them.\n",

      "My last reason why i think the principal should not require a B or higher to play sports is because many kids get in it to get better at it, or to face their fears. Bullies are teasing other kids just because their not strong. That's not good for them. it makes them feel bad. If they join sports it might help them. Knowing that everything the bullies say is not true. But if they get a C on some subject they won't be able to keep their self-confidence. that's why i think the principal should not require a B or higher to play sports.\n",

      "People say that by joining sports students do bad in school. That's not true. There is a lot of other thing that are keeping the student to complete the assignments. Playing video games, doing chores, its not just because they joined a sport in school. In fact that help them do better in school. If they like what they are doing and they know you need to have a C or above to stay in the team. They are working hard to do good in school.\n",

Although this would encourage student growth in the educational areas, it near annihilates their skills in the athletic aspects. Furthermore, this type of pressure might actually harm the students more than it helps them. Just as the lack of light will cause darkness, the lack of choice will lead to freedom's demise.\n",

Though this decision of your is hardly something to write home about, it does indeed go against the very ideals of the American person. In a time of such lack of faith, must you take away the only order these kids believe in? Can you really stand by as our grandest liberty is slaughtered 'fore our very eyes? Have some mercy on the poor souls, if for no other reason than because you still can.\n",

One who strives to become the best at something, no matter what this thing may be, should have the opportunity to do so. Are those not the very words that drove our marvelous ancestors to allow our future generations a better education? By going against that notion, you are going against the idea of education itself! The one reason you could possibly support this idea with is the grandest reason why you should not do so! Can you be so blind?\n",

      "Perhaps you have come to ignore these reasons. Perhaps you are not considering this letter of any importance whatsoever. I do not blame you, for I myself could easily do the same. But let me ask of you this; why would you do such a thing. Truly, what compels you to do so? Your reasons, if they are to be justified, and only be back-up by the fact that you wish to help these students. Yes, I'm quite sure that will be your plead. But even such a noble cause is not noble if done through evil deeds. Putting this kind of stress on a student is hardly a matter you can just shrug off and say \"Ah, no biggie, I'm sure it'll work itself out.\" This kind of pressure with hinder all attempts at teaching these kids useless, as they will not want to learn.

I think if this does happen students would really be upset because almost everyone likes gym because we do a lot of fun stuff in there and everyone should get a workout so yeah..

I think many parents would be angry too, because they like to go watch their child or children do their sport that they love. There are many reasons why you shouldn't take the policy to B average. Especially because kids wont be getting their exercise they need and if they have the sport to keep them active then you should not change the policy. A lot of the kids is SCHOOL_NAME does sports, and I'm sure they all enjoy doing the sport that they do. Then if you take the sports away from the children some wont get exercise and some will turn obese and that's what SCHOOL_NAME is all about. Making sure the students are healthy and normal weight, and ever student gets the right amount of exercise they need.

I think that when a student participates in a school activity and has a grade below a C, he should have time bring his grade up in school.

      "For the fact that , having a \"C\" average is better than an \"F\" average? Sports have influenced me the most, throughout the school year to keep my grades up.

It gives our students the time to make up the grade.\n",

The reason why is student work hard at school they still do they work but it hard maintain a B average for student even for the ones that do not play sports. I should know i run track for SCHOOL_NAME and i have an A, B, C average in SCHOOL_NAME and it is tough to keep that average. Yes you feel we can do better but not half the student in all the united states can not make a B average . The reason I can cause i put my study time in class or at break or sometime at PE and expository classes. Some student do not get the help i do but keep their average at a C witch is still difficult to do for me and other fellow student in the united states. Think back when you played sports in middle school and high school was it difficult for you or not. I feel you would get a lot more grade pull ups if slack down the grade positioning just to play sports. you said you can still past with a D average, but we can't play sports with a C average. It not right for student who work hard in subjects that they are really learning for the first time and their pasting higher than the ones who past with D averages. So please TEACHER_NAME do not make where student that play sports have to make a B average just to play sports.\n",

      "Nowadays, students take advantage of sports and extra curricular activities. They think they can just get by with a C average or a D average. If they want extra, then they have to work hard in school and in extra curricular activities. The B average policy should be in effect because students obviously need that extra push to better their lives. Also, if no one had a B average or above, then the school will have a larger budget for other important things. In addition, the students who do have a B average or above get recognized and rewarded for their good efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we don't give today's youth an extra push, and just let them go off into the world being average or not trying as hard because all their lives, the respected adults were letting them off easy and not preparing them for reality, then our world will fail. Our America as we know it today will fail. In other countries, they don't have nearly as much breaks and days off that we do. Today's youth has gotten lazy, and used to everyone just giving, giving, giving, instead of giving, taking, giving, taking. That's why I want to push myself. I have self drive and self motivation. If the youth aren't motivated to do their best and help today's economy and society, then life won't be worth living once they've messed up, because they can't start over life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine if everyone in the school had C averages, and this policy was in motion, then the school will have a larger budget. That might sound like the school is selfish, but they can use the large budget to get better lunches, for field trips, and other things like that. Today's economy is struggling, and some schools have to cut programs with kids in it that do have an above B average. This school could be that, or it could be the one who cares about the kid's education. I fully understand how extra curricular activities are very helpful in the development of young people, but they are just using it as an excuse to slack off. I have seen it first hand, and it is just flat out wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have all A's and only one B. I take pride in doing my work, and seeking extra help when I need it. One can not just coast by and think the world is just going to come to them. They have to reach out and grab it by the neck. The students who do that should get recognized for their achievements. Here at SCHOOL_NAME, they have the OTHER_NAME. Those are things where students get rewarded for their achievements. The reason why jocks are stereotyped as dumb or stupid is because the authorities ignore the fact that the kid is failing all their classes. They just pay attention to the game record, and the reputation of the school.\n",

      "TEACHER_NAME, if you were to change the school policy it might be difficult to maintain a B grade average because some of us students might have difficulties in one class and might need a little help in one lesson that they didn't understand. but that isn't a real reason to kick a person off the team, that is really unfair because maybe the sport or activity is what the person has passion for. Its like trying to take a bottle away from a baby when its hungry. I myself am very passionate about soccer, soccer is an active and painful sport but its what i love doing, just feel that rush of adrenaline run through your veins and being able to say \"I wona gold metal because I was in the forward.\" Every person wants to complete this phrase\n",

      "Dear principal, I STUDENT_NAME a student in SCHOOL_NAME do not like your opinion in the new policy . The grade doesn't mater in sports or in talent . The grades shouldn't matter because they don't belong in sports. What if you wanted to play a sport in your school but you have low grades and cant play , how would you feel ? Well i would feel not important and not valuable. I really like that sport but cant play it because of my grades . Its not fair that only people with good grades or a b average can play sports . What if I was one of the best soccer players and I have a c average , would you let me play or would you let the soccer team loose in all of the games , and be named the worst soccer team in Texas. Or would you leave the policy as it is. Not change anything and let me play ,and make the soccer team win, and be named the champions because we always win in all of the games .\n",

      "\n",
      "Many of the students, including myself, feel that you should allow students with a C average to participate in sports. Because many of the athletes on the teams have only a C average. Now some of them might have higher scores but the ones who don't shouldn't be kicked out of the activities they like. Some students are not as smart academically as they are good physically. But we the students feel that as long as they are smart enough to get a C average than they should be allowed to participate in sports. If you approve the new policy, odds are we wont have any sports teams anymore and the ones we do have will be very small. Our teams are mostly made up of C average students.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel the reason that is, is because many of the smarter students are more interested in science, history, reading, etc. That may not be the case for everyone but for the most part it is true. If you were to pass the policy there would be a huge outrage within the student body system. And many of the athletes that are C average, would go to other places to play sports. And I know from personal experience that it costs money to partake in sports. You must pay for the jerseys and the coach and ref fees. So if you made that policy then the school would be losing money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although those two reasons are fairly good reasons I think, there is another reason that I feel is the best reason of all. My main reason for going against this policy is, think about the students. Most of them do not like school and that is why they are getting a C average. And participating in sports makes them actually want to go to school so they can enjoy the sports. And if you stop allowing the C average kids in sports, then all of those kids will lose all interest is school. They will stop caring and trying. I feel that as a principal it is your job to want the best for our kids. And that in turn means that you want them to try their hardest and do well. But if you take away their reason to try, they will take away the effort. It may cost more, or be harder to let all the students in, but I feel and you should hopefully feel that the cost is worth it if it gives the kids hope, fun, and a reason to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "That alone is enough of a reason I feel, not to put that new policy into action. But if you feel that those reasons aren't good enough, then put that new policy into action and then look at the student's grades and efforts at school. And then you can see how they would probably have dropped tremendously. Because they have to reason to try if they get nothing good or fun out of it. And you can also look at all of our past trophies and awards and think about how we won't get many more because all of our good players got kicked off. So if you decide to pass it, I hope you can work the other problems that come from it out, and if you decide, to listen to this advice and take this all into consideration, and decide not to pass it. Then I can almost guarantee that our football teams, track teams, baseball teams, basketball, softball, lacrosse, water polo, and soccer teams will all thank you for it. Because you give them reasons to try in school. Which also means they'll try during a game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which will bring our school honor, respect, dignity, and most importantly it will bring us closer together as a group. So we can all stop arguing and fighting and help improve our schools, communties, towns, and cities.\n",

      "\n",
      "I think that the policy change is a great idea. The students need to have something to motivate them to do their school work and get good grades. Sports are the perfect motivation. Students are very serious about their athletic ability. Some students only think about the special sport they play, and live only to play it. They need the motivation to do their school work and study for assessments, and the way to do that is to tell them if they get anything lower than a B average, then they wont be able to play on their sports team(s).\n",
      "\n",
      "Discipline is the way to go when it comes to schoolwork. The students need to be told what to do, otherwise, they think they do whatever they want, be lazy, and not care about their schoolwork. Yes, it is great to do sports and to be active, but school always comes first. At least, that's what my dad always said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some students just don't understand the point in school, and why it's so important in your life. They don't know that your grades now effect your chances to get into the college you want, or the high school you want. School is to get you ready for your life career of your choice. Your career effects your life; your pay, the things you want to buy, the things you need to buy, activities, and more. I think students just need to understand that school now effects everything in your life, and you always have to try your best. Even if you have a bad teacher, or a good teacher, you need to make it work for yourself, and study hard every night, the way that's best for you. I'm not saying you have to do school work 24/7. You need to have fun too, you have to have some kind of balance. But always, school work is first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sports aren't as important as school, so I think if the students aren't up to working hard in order to play the sport they love, then that's alright. They don't need sports. They can for sure live without sports. What you can't live without, is a good education. Over all, I think the policy change will benefit many students here in SCHOOL_NAME.\n",

It wouldn't be fair to reward the students who don't try in school and don't care if they do bad. Even if there are students who do try, it would give them a good opportunity to try and do better. There would be much more students working hard and getting better grades. It would be a much better chance to see what our school is really capable of. Parents and teachers would be very proud and students would feel confident. This would be a good way in showing how much the students improved. Lots, of students are lacking off and not paying attention from marking period to marking period. Having this new rule would be A goal to reach for every student who wants to join a sport. If more kids do good, friends of their's might try and do good as well. Every body will know that the students on sports have good grades and they would be like roll models to every one else. I know that this would be a great idea and that students would do much better in almost everything when they grow up.

      "I think you should at least have up too a D grade point average because even during when i played wrestling, or football i had a D and one F but i got the F up but they still wouldn't let me practice or do anything because i still got that D. What I think the you as a principle should do is u should be at least passing five of your classes and should have at least a grade point average of 1.5. At my school in the SCHOOL_NAME is that policy and i am glad too have it but it didn't really matter to me because i was just falling! I was falling because of all my test and everything but i think its just dumb if you have to have at least a B average if that was our school i would at least write a banner saying we should have at least be passing five of our classes and we should be able to have a 1.5 grade point average that's when freedom of speech comes in! So o hope if the principle reads this he will agree with me! It should really be that hard if you listen to me? Don't you wont to see everyone out in the football field, or wrestling mat, or basketball court, or even if you are doing cross country? I would be glad everyone wants to be so active and would change it so you could make their dreams come true!! So i really hope you listen to me because its better if you got people that want to do sports but they cant because at least a B grade point average they could be at home doing drugs, something that will get them into trouble so if u change it too my idea they will be where you could see them, watch them so they don't get sent to detention hall (DH) or anything like that!\n",

You may also say if the students get involved in sports with low grades , sports will soon become there first priority , but you can always maintain sports and keep a C average , that's not asking for to much.

I understand that all students are able to achieve that letter grade but what if something goes wrong with the grading system or you got a grade you weren't suppose to have. Its only right to base it off they're behavior or they're character in class or how they've acted at other activities. Sometimes you may not turn in a assignment or you did do it but you got a bad grade for it. Anything could happened, its always good to strive for excellence but what if something is distracting that student at home where he/she might not have a chance to study or do his homework you have to take every aspect in to viewpoint. What if one student is homeless and he has no were to live all he can do is try his best at school. I think that if you raise the bar high enough people will strive to meet the criteria but if they don't make it but they've tried give them that opportunity to say ok next time i will do better than the last time. If i was the principal i would give students another chance if they didn't make the requirement of a b average as long as i see that they really mean that they will change they're behavior or grades. i can understand the principal's attitude on changing policy to see if the students can perform at that level but sometimes you have to take certain things into perspective.\n",

      "On top of that, students don't strive for that high GPA that gets the students into college.\n",
      "\n",
      "To top it all off increasing the GPA to participate in sports can help raise the school's grade average.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, the students who has a 4.0 GPA are awarded with not making a sporting team because the student with a 2.0 GPA makes the team.\n",

      "Some students blow off school and just practice their sport and don't receive the scholarship that they wanted and they are stuck with a 2.0 GPA.\n",

      "He is now stuck with a 2.0 GPA trying to find a collage that will accept him. With the new rule if they don't get the scholarship they would then have a 3.0 GPA when looking for collages.\n",

      "I disagree with you that kids should be getting at least a B or better average to be able to participate in school sports. Everyone has there bad days and maybe does bad on a test, and gets a D, but just because they had a bad grade doesn't mean sports and other activities should be taken away and also a lot of kids don't like school but love sports or a activity ,so you shouldn't take that away from them if they get a C or below in a class.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first reason that our school shouldn't change the grade average for students to get into sport or activity is because a lot of kids have a hard time with school, but love sports. I must say that I'm a sport lover also I do a lot of school activities, and get A' s, and B' s. But occasionally I do get a lower grade on a test or homework. And if your teacher doesn't give you a lot of homework, that grade can bring your grade down a lot! So if I have a bad test score and that brings me down to a C, I can't join the cheer leading squad or the writing club? That's not right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason I don't think our school should switch to a B average in order to play sports or join activities is that not all kids are school smart. Even though teachers are helping them they just don't like or have trouble in school, but that doesn't mean there not smart or good in sports! We all have different likes and dislikes, and those kids shouldn't get there like taken away from them just because they don't succeed in school.\n",

      "I think that students should be able to play sports and do activities without having to have a B average. i say this because many students don't have a B average. So many students wouldn't be able to play sports and we would hardly have any sports teams. not to mention students wouldn't be able to get the strength and exercise that they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, many students don't have a B average. For some people it is hard to achieve. For example my school has about a C average. therefore my school would not be able to play school sports and do school activities as often as they should. according to SCHOOL_NAME right now 89 percent of schools are allowed to play sports and do activities with at least a C average at the moment. our students should have to work harder than they should have to just to play a sport and i don't think that's fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, if every one had to have a B average just to play sports then our school would hardly have any SCHOOL_NAME teams. if we don't have any teams then we cant verse any other schools and that would make us very unexciting. our students would not be able to enjoy the excitement of getting team uniforms and have school rivalry's. we also wouldn't be able to interact with other schools. like one time i met my best friend through out a volleyball game and she didn't even go to my school. she was from SCHOOL_NAME and was on the other team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, when your playing sports or doing activities you getting tons of exercise. this is another good reason why TEACHER_NAME should definitely not consider only allowing B average students to play in sports and activities. According to health magazine, 74 percent of kids are overweight due to no exercise and lack of agility. This idea would just add to the percent... do you want this for your students?\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, i once again say that i believe that you should allow students with a C average to play sports and be involved in activities. as mentioned before, most of the students in my school don't have a B average, not many schools do. Do you really not want SCHOOL_NAMEto not have any school teams. and do you want your students to be healthy? and to not to be able to interact with other schools. well if not , please consider not going along with your plans.\n",

      "I am an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME and I'm for students to have a grade B average to participate in sports and other activities. It is un-right that students don't have to work hard to do something great or incredible. Students should show that, \"Hey, I deserve this. I worked hard and got good grades. Let me get to do this activity.\" Instead of this, \" Oh, well i did my best i could and still got okay grades. I should get to do this.\" That isn't right.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of what's good is, \"I'm in NJHS ( National Junior Honor Society) and I keep my grades above an 85, and i do my community service hours.\" That sounds great, and you know what, it is. Those are the kind of students that get to stay in something like that. They are proving to people that they really want to do this. They are the students that should be in these groups, and still get to do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of a student who doesn't work for it is this. \"I'm in NJHS, i get B's and C's, and i don't do my community hours. It doesn't matter if I do bad now, I am just trying to do this.\" That's just proving that you never try your best to do anything. You just try to do it, but you aren't proving it that you should be in this school group.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example is in sports. A lot of students like to go out for sports during the year. They make it, but most of the top players never get to play that much. That's because they are to worried about practicing the sport, and not caring about their grades. Students who do keep their grades up get to play, because they are more worried about keeping their grades up instead of practicing, because grades go first before anything does.\n",
      "\n",
      "My final example is school clubs. I play chess twice a week with all of my friends, because it's fun and relaxing to do after a long day of school, but a lot of students like to go to chess to just hang out and not care to play. If you going to go to a school club, actually go and do what you're suppose to do, not just watch people play, but you playing against them, and winning. But the only way to do that is to keep our grades up, so if don't have a good grade in that class, you shouldn't be going to a club till you proven yourself that i achieved the grade to stay in, but just don't try, go above and beyond what you could do, and keep doing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that is why school should come first, then you figure out what to do for an activities. You should always, and I mean always deal with school work first, and just say \"Okay I reached to grade I need to stay or join,\" but keep going of what you can do. Reach you're full potential, and you should be awarded for what you have done.\n",

I feel so strongly about this because I have a grade average of B. I'm also a cheerleader at your school and if my grade were to drop. then I would be kicked off the team. TEACHER_NAME I love to cheer and school is for the students to have and great education\n",
      "\n",
      "I know but this plan to change the policy would not help nor support me/ us because many students have a grade c average.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example with this plan I need to have at least a 2.0 to stay on the team. lets say my grades drop but I still have at least a 2.0 so I have time to get my grade up so I wont get kicked off the team. with this new possible policy I will be kicked off the team and once your off any school activities you cannot come back. like I said you I love cheering so would you take this letter under deep thought when you are deciding whether or not you should put this new possibly policy in place.

      "I am highly concerned student from SCHOOL_NAME. There is a big issue that your school has, and we would like you to fix it. The issue is our inability to take part in sports activities if we have below a B average. Many of the students including me think this is unfair to the students. One of the main reasons is that a B average is above average which is a C. Many of your students in this school have a C which is expected of most students and is considered passing therefore the grade expectancy should be lowered to a c avrage. You may not feel that would be good enough for your students but it is the average for all schools in the country and the average grade your students in your school are getting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another concern of yours may be that the students in the sports program may slack at school if you lower the grade level. I can assure u that will not happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of my fellow students at our school take pride in our school work and never get below a C-, I suggest if they do that they should get some source of extra studying or tutoring to be able to stay in the sports activities we offer here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a good reason also to allow C ranking students in because it keeps students busy. With out the program there would be a lot of your students getting in to trouble . Such as joining gangs and doing drugs or getting into fights Sports is a good source of virtue to students my age. Its good to have values you may acquire from sports instead of us being juvenile delinquents from bad choices you do when you have nothing better to do. You do not want those bad types of kids going to your school i presume ?\n",

      "I think that you should change the grade average to B. It would be good for the students at SCHOOL_NAME.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would encourage them to pull their grades up and try harder in school. It would also help them with getting scholarships and other important opportunities. Let me put it this way; if you make the grade average a B, students will try harder in school, so they can play sports and participate in other after school activities. Then if they get their grades up they'll be like \"hhmmmm\" maybe getting good grades isn't so bad after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean think about it good grades + sports or other after school activities= success. Students will be more likely to succeed in life. They'll also be proud of themselves for setting and achieving a goal. It'll also look good on their college applications. I mean either way, whether students have to have a B or C average it'll look good, but a B average and sports will look great. Not only for the student, but for the school to for encouraging students to strive harder for better grades and to support their fellow flucos.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all I think that you should change the grade average, but its your decision not mine. It will help students succeed more if you do and look good on their applications to college. More colleges might check out SCHOOL_NAME students because of their grades and how well they play in sports. I think all around it would be good for everybody not just the students.\n",

      "The students at SCHOOL_NAME would like you to change the grade policy from B to c' s .Because most of the athletes here are going to games and have practice after school so its hard for them to do there homework because they get home and their tired from running around for a few hours. Then on top of that they have to wary about their game .And that's why the students here think that you should change it from a B' s to c' so that the athletes aren't working so hard.\n",

      "\n",
      "As of two weeks ago, I understand that you have considered changing the policy of our academic program here at SCHOOL_NAME so that students may not participate in sports or other activities, such as clubs, unless they have at least a B average in all their classes, which is 86 percent or above. I also understand that you would like to hear the opinions of your students about the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of what I have heard, student don't seem to like the change very much but parents agree with the new policy idea. But as for me, I tend to lean towards the idea of the new policy. I agree that students should have to earn the opportunity to be involved with extra curriculum. The case of most students is that they get very involved with the after school activity and they forget that it comes after school. That's why they call it \"after school activity\". Therefore, their grades begin to drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students may think of this policy unfair but at the same time they are working hard to meet the goal to bring all their grades up to a B average. This policy will give our students the determination to be in sports or any other activities and they will care about their schoolwork a whole lot more than before. If all of our students have excellent marks it will also give our school a great reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I agree with your new ideas and I hope that you follow through with them. I'm sure that if you do, you will be happy with the results.\n",

      "There are many different ways this may affect our school. In good ways and bad. For all we know if students really care about their sports like me, I'm almost positive this will make them make better grades.\n",
      "\n",
      "But also, at a school like this, where we have tremendous athletes, they might not stop playing sports because they would rather slack off. If that's the case then you would have a lot on your hands to deal with from parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also sure that you will be hearing a lot of complaints, not just from our students, but other schools too. You might set an example that most kids look at as a punishment and other schools might fallow in your footsteps. Because the rule has always been a \"C\" average I do not think that you should change the policy for just our school. That seems unfair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Get this rule approved by the SCHOOL_NAME so all schools have to change it if you really want it to be different, but don't just change it for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a \"C\" isn't failing. I mean it's not the best grade in the world but its not nearly the worst. You don't have to go to 9th period if you have a \"C\". You don't have to go to summer school if you have a \"C\". So why should you not be aloud to play sports if you have a \"C\".\n",

One of them is that may be after school programs is the only way some of the students stay out of trouble. So then with you taking that away from them, they will have nothing else to do . Then they will turn to the streets, and i know you wouldn't want that for our fellow students .\n",
      "\n",
      "Also may be them getting a C grade average is the best they can do. Then our school wouldn't have the best after school activities we could have. Then the people who enjoy it the most , but doesn't meet the standard wouldn't have the ability to get a scholar ship in it even if they need it the most. Another reason is that, without after school activities students wouldn't really be able to work out. Then we would have even more students turning obesity.\n",

Everyone is always so worried about sports that no one has any time to do there homework and finish class work, but then there are those people that can and do have time to do that, so that's why they get a B. I hope you can understand what I am trying to say.\n",

      "I do agree with you and you should change it.

      "As a student that participates in sports, I know how myself and the other athletes feel about the new academic standards. Many students have been working on raising their grades, and this can be achieved only if time is allowed. I understand that this school strives for academic excellence, but students also need exercise and after-school activities in order to succeed in and out of school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students have learned how to make time for studying and sports, and have kept to the previous standard of an overall C average. I believe many of these students' grades would drop if they did not have to keep to those standards. They might also drop if the students weren't also challenged in other ways. My fellow students agree that we can all keep a B average, but should not be penalized right away due to the short notice of this change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raising a grade does not happen over night. These students will still be studying as much as possible, and doing their absolute best on all assignments as usual. Of course, tests can be weeks apart. The school should have a testing period before they decide the new policy is the official one. During this period, no student should be penalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sports keep students focused. If you suspend the student from an extra-curricular that he/she loves, the student won't be trying to learn, they will be trying to memorize enough to barely pass. By accepting that students can achieve the acceptable average while still playing with their team, both parties will be happy in the end. Especially while this new standard is still being thought out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The athletes believe they should be allowed to keep the C average standard for the rest of the 2010-2011 school year. If the school board still in the end decides to make their new standards the official policy, the students will be coming in with a new attitude on the first day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The school's standards have been effective for some time, each student graduating and moving on to exceptional high schools; some even with sports scholarships! Why would the school want to change a good thing? Our school has pride due to academic, religious, social, and sporting excellence. By allowing students to work at their own pace, the school will be able to keep their high standards and reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please consider this proposal because it comes from the core of the school - from the students themselves. They know that it is possible to keep to academic standards while participating in something they love. By working together and hearing all sides of the argument, I am certain that a final decision can be arranged; one in which all parties are happy.\n",

      "Kids at SCHOOL_NAME should be able to participate in sports, even if they have a grade C average. Grades shouldn't have to interfere with sports, their are two different subjects. they are both very important to kids. There are three reason why kids should still participate in sports even with a C average.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason is, some kids that want to grow up and be a pro soccer player or a pro football player don't need school for it. Kids want to dedicate their time to sports to get better at it, and not on homework or studying. For some kids spots is all they think about because its their dream to become a pro soccer player or pro football player.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second reason is, sports sometimes aren't the only reason why kids have a C average. So why would sports need to be taken away for the grades if playing sports isn't the problem. Kids might have a C average because they don't try in school or they need help on what their learning. Principles and parents should encourage kids to do their work, study for tests, and help them.

My personal opinion is that people are the only thing that should be in control of a car so that there is not question on what happened if there was to be an accident. Is the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" it even states that these cars warn the person in the car whenever they might have to take over because te cars can't move around an accident or for any other reason. The reason the cars do this is because they don't have the technology to navigate themselves through a car accident, around a construction site, or if there is major traffic ahead. I believe that these cars are unsafe and will cause harm to people because of the lack of fully advanced technology.\n",

The first reason why I think it's a good idea is, because if the cars are able to dive themselfs we the people will see less crashes on the rodes. Lets take I-65 for an example we the people see the news and we see and hear about all the crashes that happen on there. We also can look at I-70 as well its not as bad as I-65 though.\n",

I want to be able to go place to place without hlaf to think or WORRY about any of the stupid people on the rodes.\n",

      "I mean take a moment to think about how much better the rodes will be if stupid people can not drive places where they want to go. If people wanted to go some where the car will drive them there all we the peopel have to do is sit there and talk and have some fun. wouldn't that be so much fun though. There will be a lot less crashes and people dieing because of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last thing that I would want to say is, lets thinks about all the little kids that are in the car and all the little kids getting hurt form being in a car where some stupid person hit the car and the kids get ether really hurt or even die. Just think about that for a litte bit. and Thinks about it when you drive today or when you start driveing. Dont be a stupid kid and race peopel and do bren outs and stuypid stuff like that. All you have to do is drive to one place to another.\n",

      "I believe that is is time to get rid of the electoral college. The electrorial college is outdated and irrational, the best arguments are only assertions that dont have much basis in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are too many faults and risks in the electoral college such as the coming of a tie in the voting and that even though one canidate may win the popular vote they can still lose the election. As Bradford Plumer says \"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now\" (paragraph 9). It would be better in elections for it to go by popular vote instead of representatives deciding for you. A solution for this could be to simply go by popular vote. There is also the fact that the electors could defy the will of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electors are not trust worthy. \"Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy\" (Bradford paragraph 11). They did this so the popular vote would not actually go to Kennedy. In the past electors have refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a vote on whomever they want. People are thinking we have \"faithless\" electors because of this. We need to select electors that we can trust will go by the states overall decision instead of their own personal preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is hard to vote for the president not knowing if your vote is actually going to mean anything. Us as voters cannot control what the electors do and who they vote for, we just have to hope that our canidate wins. Us as voters also sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. The voters need to know that their vote is going to mean something for the canidates running and that their decision will be taken into consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude the electoral college is not a safe and trust worthy system. I believe that the arguments against electoral colleges are much stronger tyhan the ones saying to keep it around, give the people what they want. No more electoral college!\n",

      "I have come to a conclusion that keeping the Eletoral College would be a much better process instead of an unorganized popular vote. The electoral college is a great process with the votes in congress and a vote of the qualified cictizens. It is more organized with five benifits of certainity of outcome, trans- regonal appeal, winner-take-all method, big states, and avoiding run-off elections. These benifits help the elections go more smoothly. The Electoral College process has a selection of electors that vote for president and vice president, and the counting of electoral votes by congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\" The dispute over outcome of an electoral college is possible if it happened in 2000 but is less likley than a dispute over the popular vote\". \"For example, Obama got sixty-one point seven percent of the electoral vote to only fofty-one point three percentof popular votes cast frm him and Romney... \"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the reason for a less likley dispute over a popular vote is because of the winning candidates share of the electoral college. Basically and eletoral vote can be tied by the total number of votes. Even fivehundred thirtyeight is an even number and also unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The electoral college requires for a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "None of the regions have enouough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,  and also gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states he knows he will win in only. It results to just regional apeal and is unlikely going to be a successful president. The residents of other regionds are most likley going to feel like there votes do not count, the new president will have no regards for there intersts, and he is not realy their president.\n",
      "\n",
      "\" The winner- take-all methode of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The toss-states mostly pay more attention to the campaign and listen to the competitors and they know thay are going to decide the election. They are the most thoughtful voters and they have the most informationand attention. These states should be the ones to decide the election.\n",

      "Big states get some of the weight restored in political balance by population and lose by virtue of mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dear Governor,\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe we need to keep the Electoral College. It seems to provide a more efficient way of deciding who will be the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "There may seem to be many problems with the electoral college, but there are just as many things that are good about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the passage\n",
      "\n",
      "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it lists several good points of how the electoral college helps us choose our president. The first point is Certainty of Outcome. In the passage, it states that the Electoral College usually exceeds the amount of popular votes they have because most states use a winner-take-all basis if they so much as have a one percent higher difference than their opponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next point is: with the Electoral College, you can't win by just winning over one region (South, Northeast, etc.). In order to have enough Electoral College votes to win, you have to be accepted nation wide. You can't win by just being supported by the South or only the Midwest, you have to be supported by several regions. In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was a solid regional favorite in the South. He has no chance of winning extra Electoral College votes if he only campaigns in states he knows he's going to win. This is a perk of the Electoral College because if the candidate has only regional appeal, he's less likely to be a good President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third point is the swing states. These are states that are not set on one certain party, such as Demorats in Texas or Republicans in California. The voters in toss-up states are the most studious of the campaign because they know they are the ones who will ultimately decide who will win the election. The voters in these states will pay closer attention to the debates, do further research into the claims the candidates place against each other, and they also recieve the most information and attention from the campaign. These voters are thought to be the most thoughtful and often decide the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth point is about the big states. In the passage it states: \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution...\" The larger states usually end up getting more attention from the candidates than the smaller states because the larger states have more electoral votes than the smaller states. For example, in 2012, the popular vote in Florida was very close, and yet Obama still got the 29 electoral votes. A victory the same way in Wyoming would only give the winner 3 electoral votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth, and final, point is that the Electoral College can help avoid run-off elections. It can help avoid the problem of elections in which neither of the candidates has the majority vote. For example, Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton both had only 43% of the popular vote, while they both had a lead in the Electoral College. There would be no pressure for a tied election if none of the candidates wins a majority of the votes. That pressure, which usually complicates the election process, is cut back by the Electoral College, which will give a clear answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it can be said that the Electoral College method of choosing the president can turn potential voters away from a candidate that has no hope of carrying their state. Voters knowing their vote will have no effect are more likely to pay less attention to the campaign than they would be if the popular vote decided the President. Either way, no voter's vote is going to swing a national election and, with that information in mind, about half of the eligable voters in America voted in 2012's election.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to me that the Electoral College helps more than it harms the election. I believe the Electoral College should remain intact as it provides a more efficient way of deciding who will become President.\n",

      "My name is PROPER_NAME, I'm here to talk to you about keeping the electoral college. The electoral college is a prodess that our founding fathers established. Its said to be in pur decleration as part of the 23rd amendment. For so the district of Columbia is allocated 3 elctors but only for the electoral college. With saying we vote every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When a citizan votes for their candidate choice they are also voting for the candidate's electors.\n",

      "There are ups and downs to having the Electoral College. For one the peoples opinion should matter. They were given a gallup poll in which over 60% of the voters prefer a direct election. In 2000 we had our great fiasco which was the biggest election crisis. Eventually the electoral college fixed it. When ever the votes are tied the house of representatives get involved which can change the whole election.\n",
      "\n",
      "With saying all of this there are 5 reasons to keep our lovely electoral college:\n",

      "1) Certainty of outcome:\n",

      "2) Everyone's President:\n",
      "\n",
      "One region (south, northeast, etc.) does not have enough votes to elect a president. In saying that no favorite candidate recieves any electoral votes just because he increased his plurality in states that for a fact he can win in.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Swing States:\n",
      "\n",
      "The winner-take-all method shows the candidates that they should pay attention to the toss-up states. These states will pay very close attention to the candidates campaign, showing that they need to focus on their campaigns. The toss-up states are more likely to be the thoughtful voters and the most thoughtful votes should decide the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Big States:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does\"\n",

The state senator should change the voting system to popular vote, because you're giving the American people what they want, it gets more people to participate and vote, and it lessens conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start, the senator should change the voting system to popular vote, because it gives the people what they want. If we rely on the Electoral College to elect our congress, presidents, senators, or whatever then what are the people voting for? People vote for who they want, so wouldn't make sense to elect the canidate with the most votes, since thats what the people want. Say there were two students running for class president, PROPER_NAME and PROPER_NAME. PROPER_NAME got 75% of the students votes while PROPER_NAME only got 25% of the students votes. In the end PROPER_NAME wins the election, because a group of teachers voted she should be president. Thats how the electoral college acts, like their vote counts more then the peoples.\n",
      "\n",
      "To add on, they should change the voting system to popular vote, because it gets more people to participate and vote. Many people are not going to waist their time and vote for the canidate they want, when most likely that canidate will not even get elected. This will effect the whole process, if there is a decrease in people voting. To encourage people to vote give them hope that the canidate they vote for will have a shot at winning the election. They should not have to think my vote does not matter. They should feel like they actually have a say in the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, changing the voting system to a poplular vote can lessen conflict. When people see that who they are voting has a great chance at winning, but does not get elected, lets just say there can be outbursts. People usually start to protest in what they believe is fair. To decrease insidents like this give the people a fair vote and fair election. The people should come together and fairly vote on the canidate they want to be elected. For the benefit of the American citizens, let them know they have a voice in the elections, do not take their freedom of speech away from them; give them what they want. Yes we can vote!\n",

      "After experiencing the dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote in 2000 I realized that the Electoral College is an old fashioned and unfair voting system for our next presidents. The vote of all United States citizens should be taken account but with each state only getting a single vote it is highly inethical for a state with 500,000 voters like Wyoming and a state with 35 million voters like California having the same amount of votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The candidates who of course want to win will want to spend there time campaigning in states they think they have a chance of winning over but what about states that they do not think will vote for them?

      "Past presidents like Bod Dole, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter even agreed to destory the Electoral College. If even presidents want to abolish the Electoral College then what is stopping us from doing so. It's time we make a change to this irrational way of voting and start valuing the opinons of each United States citizen. The only way to do this is to start having direct elections and stop using the Electoral College way of voting. I am positive that this will have a positive affect on how people look up to the government because it will finally make them feel that the government values there opinons.\n",

      "Dear State Senator,being apart of the voting process is extremely important.It's important,because you are helping by popular vote for the president of the United States.Electoral College helps you get a better understanding of the voting process and the effect that everyone's vote has.However,the Electoral colleges are not a really big help when it comes down to the country.Here is provided information about why they should change election by popular vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "First to start the discussion,Electoral Colleges were estblished by the founding fathers in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by popular vote.The Electoral College is not just a place it's an important process.This college is made of electors.They have meetings where they vote for the president and vice president.The college is consisted of 538 electors.At least 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president.Each candidate that is interested in becoming president in your state has to have his or her own flock of electores.The electors are chosen by the political party ran by the candidate.This college basically provides you with a idea of why it is important to vote. The country's fate rests in the hands of many.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next,The Electoral college system only allows voters to vote for the slate electors. The president of the United States votes is more important then the slate electors.The president of the United States is the one responsible for the Country.Most people refer to the most common argument between the electoral college as the disater factor.Like for instance if someone wanted to vote for a specific person you would have to vote for a different amount of slate electors also depending where you lived as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuing,the Electoral college is really regarded as an anachronism aslo known as a non-democratic method of selecting a president. Many people believe that,that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves more popular votes is the winner.Each party selects a slates of electors that is trusted to vote for the nominee that was picked slate electors.Even though the Electoral has a lack of conservative reasons, there are five reasons that people think that should be retained. The first reason is the certainy of outcome,second Everyone's President,third Swing states,fourth Big States,and lastly Avoiding run-off Elections.These 5 things are reasons why people feel that these colleges should stay.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conclusion, the president of the United states is chosen by our votes.We have the power to make this country strong,but we also have the power to make this country a train wreck.Voting is really important this can determine the fate of the country.\n",

      "I argue you in favor of keeping the electoral college in florida. i think it's a easier and better process than popular vote. It seems like to me it would take forever to count all the votes and add them up in all 50 states. our government counts all the votes up anyway but they count them by just it's own state. I feel like everyones voice is getting heard because it counts your vote but it's your states that votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one problem I have with the electoral college is that some states are worth more votes than other states, which in my eyes is alittle unfair but it's our goverment. As florida we have 29 voter points and it's very useful to the running president that they gain our state. maybe if I was in the other states that have like 2 votes for the electoral college, then maybe I would be alittle upset and I would most likely not like the electoral college. It goes by the population of the states which makes sense because we don't want a small state choosing the president. It makes a real good point that the staes don't have the same amount of points, because if a state for example has 2,000 people and the other has 3,000 people, then the bigger population state should have the more electoral points.\n",
      "\n",

But i think electoral college is a great thing for us now and in the future.\n",

      "In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,\" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election\" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, \" In the same vein, \"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the second reason why I believe that  getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, \" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote...\" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had  popular vote and no more electoral college.

      "In my opinion we should change the presidency election to be based on popular vote. I can speak for a lot of citizens here when I say that it is a way of representing our country as a democracy, and is more efficiant.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college is a better representation of a democracy. Instead of voting for your president, you're instead voting for electors. That's not what we're trying to do. The political parties of Florida are trying to get their candidate to be elected. The electoral college is a bit unfair to the other parties that aren't gettin represented. Since most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system, not all voices are being heard. With popular vote everyone's voice is being heard! We are a democracy right? Democracy means that all citizens have a say in the government. Which plays into the voting topic. We vote because we have a say in what goes on in the government, and what the decisions they make. With the electoral college, we vote for electors that vote for the president, even though the title of the event is called the presidential election! Not the electoral election!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason many people prefer the popular voting system is because it is more efficiant. This is because we can't always count on the electors we vote for to reperesent us correctly. Electors might change their mind at the very last minute and decide that they like the opposing candidate's view, discarding their loyalty to us. Now the opposing candidate has more electoral votes casted their way. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for. That's not what I would call a trustworthy system. With the electoral college, it is a slighter chance that a tie could happen. With the popular votes, there is more votes being casted to almost prevent this from happening.\n",

      "Why the Electoral College Should be Replaced\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Mr. Senator, ever since the Presidential Election of 2000, the concept of our electoral college has been highly scrutinized, and this is rightly so. The electoral college is undemocratic, unfair, and should be replaced with the popular vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even people who support keeping the electoral college (such as the author of\n",
      "\n",
      "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , Richard A. Posner) agree that \"...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense..\" (paragraph 15). America was founded on democracy and making sure that the people's voices were heard, and not allowing the people to directly vote for the leader of the country goes against that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college is also extremely unfair to voters. Because of how the election system is set up, a candidate could win the people's popular vote, but not the electoral votes and would then not recieve presidency. This occured in 2000 in the Gore vs Busch election. Even though a majority of people voted for Gore, Busch still ended up with the presidency (paragraph 9). Having the electoral votes take pecedence over the popular vote takes away the people's voice and bscially tells them that their opinion doesn't matter as much as the electoral college's opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college is also unfair because it discourages campaigning in non-swing states. A democratic candidate would not campaign in a state like California that is heavily democratic because they know they are almost definitley going to win the election in that state, meaning they will get all of that state's electoral votes. A republican candidate would not campaign in Caliornia either because they know they would have almost no chance of winning in such a heavily democratic state, and they would be wasting campaign money with no hope of electoral votes from that state (paragraph 13). This means that people in non-swing states like California don't really know much about either candidate because they were never informed. Then the people in these states tend to vote for their party solely because they have nothing else to go off of. It is unfair for voters in non-swing states to be left in the dark just because all of the electoral votes are almost guaranteed to go one way. If the US used popular votes for the Presidential Election, republicans in democratic states and democrats in republican states would have a voice too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way the electoral college is unfair, is the standing procedure in the event of a tie. There are 538 electors in the electoral college (paragraph 3) which is an even number, meaning the electoral votes for each candidate could be tied. In the event of a tie, the House of Representatives would have an election and each state would get one vote. That would mean \"...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters\" (paragraph 12). This would make someone from California's vote count for much less than someone from Wyomig's vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can be argued that the electoral college is beneficial in the fact that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to 51.3% of popular votes (paragraph 18). Some say this is beneficial because it reduces the chance of a dispute of vote counting. However, this is actually not a good thing. 51.3% of people wanted Obama to be President. Not 61.7%. Yet Obama still got credit for 61.7%. About 10% of voters who didn't support Obama didn't get their opinion heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college has been around for a long time, and it's time for a change. It is simply undemocratic and unfair. It prevents every person for having an equally weighted vote. The electoral college needs to be replaced with a popular vote.\n",

      "I, PROPER_NAME, think it is best to keep the electoral colles, but here is why. Some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the consititution is restored. The candiate must have trans regional appleal, meaning he/she must be all for each region & not just one, (South, Northeastern, etc.).  From this the residents of the other region are likelt to feel disfranchised-- to feel like their votes do not count, and that with no regard for their interests, the president is not really the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a citizen I would say that if the president, only did what half of the regions had said, then I would not be satisfied with what he is doing. When you go into office, you go into office for everyone, not just one region, but ALL regions. Wether or not the president haave a trans-appeal, each region does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president on their own anyway. Some say the electoral college is unfair. outdated, irrational, because they favor most daily assertions without much basis in reality. However the lectoral college, can be unfair. Most arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much base reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "To feel as if the president is not on your side, i dont imagine that being any fun, that to me would be like rewarding one child and not the other for the same action. We all are equal, wether by race, color, or age. We are all human, and we demand to be treated equal, if we dont get equal, keep trying until you do. Its always too early to give up. Always push yourself to high extents just like these canidates and maybe one day it will be you standing up for the majority vote, only hoping that the voters do not pick favorites, off of location. Before you decide make sure you know who youre voting for, and that there is a chance, that folur years from now, they could be re elected again, so please, put some thought into our society, and what social conflict does to us! America hass been torn apart because, of beliefs, religion, and democracies, and possibly is still suffering from all of these things, as i sit here and type this.

      "To keep the Electoral College or to change the election by popular vote is the question many people are facing today. There are many different reason why we should keep, and same for as why we should change it. I believe we should change the election from the Electoral College to popular vote because, with the Electoral College people are voting for a slate of electors not an actual presidential canidate, it is unfair for our American people, and most people prefer the popualr vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "By voting for a presidential canidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors who vote for the presidental canidate. This means that our votes don't really count for much. It also means that even though we voted for someone the slate could have voted for someone completely different. Also we the people have no idea who the electors are. Who even picks them? The electors that are chosen depends on the state, sometimes it's the state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes it can be the presidential canidate himself. Some voters didnt even see campaigne ads, so how did they chose their presidential caidate? They didn't, the Electoral College did.\n",
      "\n",
      "America is suppose to be a free state, that is fair, but are we really? The Electoral College is one thing I can point out as unfair. Most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system, that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate, but what if the people didn't want that candiate? Why should he get our way of speaking to the government? How are we even sure that he didn't elect himself? Also canidates don't spend time in the states they know they will have a chance of winning because of biasim. They mainly focus on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.\n",
      "\n",
      "In reality we all want our way, or our voice and or actions to make an impact, with the Electoral College that's not happening, which is making the people of our country unhapy with the government, which means we all can't get along. Most people prefer elections to be based on popular vote so they know they get what they want, so they know they're actually making an impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this being said, I believe I have made my impact on your thoughts of the question, \" to keep the Electoral College, or change election to popular vote?\". The Electoral College has both it's upsides and it's downside, but I believe it has more flaws than perfections. Yes, it has been around for many decades and is apart of our histroy, maybe it worked then, but it's not working now. And we need to make a change before things get worse.\n",

      "I think that our president's should be chosen by popular vote because they have better chances of winning and they will know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president's have better chances of winning because they can have the most votes and wouldn't have to wait on the Electoral College. Such as paragraph 9 says, \"Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" I think that was unfair because Al Gore could of been the president but instead he was not, after all the campaigning he did to get those voters to vote for him it ended up as a waste because the voting didn't get him anywhere. If I was a president I would be highly upset because I knew I could have a big chance of losing just because of the Electoral College. What doesn't make any sense to me is that the voters are not voting for the president but are voting for a slate of electors. What's the whole point of voting then? People are out here voting for electors that they don't even know and most of the electors are people who not holding public office. In paragraph 13 it says, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.\" To me they are cheating people out of their votes, people vote for the one that they think could make a change not just voting just to be voting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president would know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States. The electoral college votes won't help them know who is really for them and who's not because if someone win over electoral votes there are going to be people out there mad about the fact that they had won. This will make people not want to vote at all because 9 times out of 10 the person they are voting for gone lose. The electoral college just makes it difficult for the people that are running for president. I'm not saying that it should be easy to just become something big, but if you worked hard enough I think that you should be honored enough to become president through popular votes. This will make the incoming president feel appreciated for all the hard work they did to recieve all these votes. They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\" What would happen then? That's why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it.\n",

      "The Electoral college is a process that was established by our founding fathers in a constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.The electoral college consists of the selection of the electors then that carries into the meeting or gathering of the electors.In that type of meeting of the electors they vote for the president and the vice president,Next is the counting of the electoral votes by congress.The electoral college consists of 538 electors,Did you know that a majority of those elector's votes are required to elect the president.Well 270 electoral votes to be exact.Well how did the number of electorals get chosen? The way that exact number got chosen is because tehere is one electoral to each member in the House of Representatives.Don't you agree that that was a wise choice? Also dont you think that our founding fathers really sat back and but real thought and effort in to a decision like this,something to put into the constitution.\n",

The second reason why i believe that i believe that the electoral college should stay in place because that this is a good process to have in place.\n",

      "How many people do you think actually sit there and research and put thought into the president that they are chosing to run their country? Do you really belive that everyone does that? Think about the young and inexperienced voters who are fresh out of highschool and probaly just getting into college,Do you think that on top of their school work that they'll sit there and add something else on to their plate? To be completly honest i would not. I would either not vote or just pick at a random.Many people have a family and a job or jobs and have alot on their plate so the last thing they're gonna do is take the time out of their busy schedules and researchand find information on something that they dont need to do.\n",

      "I also believe that the electoral college should stay in place because it's a good process to have.

The people workers out in those lines are irritable and dont want to be there along with the voters,They look at it as a a waist of their time. No one likes to feel like their time was waisted because \"Time is Money\".\n",

      "I hope you actually get this letter,read it,and but thought into what you just read.The Electoral college is a very good process to have in effect. Remeber that it keeps peole stress free and less irritable and if you use the Electors and not citizens you will end up getting a more educated vote because they sat back and analyzed the actions from the past of each canadate that is running and is making a vote based off of knowledge,not picking at a random.\n",

      "I think it would be a good idea to change the election by popular vote for election of our president. It would be a good idea for a few reasons. One it doesn't fully represent the people, (or general population.) For example, Persident Obama in the 2012 election only recieved 51.3% of the population vote. However because of the Electoral College, he was able to become the president of the United States. And us, the voters, well we aren't even voting for our president. According to source two,\n",
      "\n",
      "The Indefensible Electoral College , \" Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" So us the people aren't even voting, do our votes really even count? Say i live in a state like Maine, then i only have 4 electoral votes, oppose to a big state like Texas, who according to the map in the third source have \"38 electoral votes\". My vote really doesnt even count. Because of the amount of votes your state gets in the upcoming election relys on the population. But every state only gets one final vote. so say Wyomming gets just as many votes as Texas, who represents 35 million voters. Do you see how this is unfair? And then theres the \"Disaster Factor\", This can destroy anyones chances at becoming president. It happened in the 60's it happened in the 2000 election, it can happen anytime. The Disaster factor is when repressentatives vote for whom ever they please. When this happened in the 60's rasists almost succeded in a plan to bump President Kennedy from the office. they were going to replace all the electors with different people to go up against Kennedy. The electors can bassically do what ever they please, considering we voted them in. They casn defy us as much as they please. In the 1968 election, just a mere 8 years after the would be catastropy of the segragationists, a tie, yes a tie, almost occured. It was about 10,000 votes away form a \"deadlock tie\". According to the second source, \" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all.\" They basically told the swing voters to take it off their hands and vote for who they pleased.

      "Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is \"an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.\" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" states that, \"it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote.\" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, \"yet, that has happened very rarely.\" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a \"winner-take-all\" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that \"the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population.\" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, \"practical\" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,\" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that \"only educated voters should decide the election,\" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.\n",

      "I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America because it makes more sence to change to the election of most popular votes because lets say people vote for one president more than the other president but the president that got less votes gets picked because he/she has more electoral votes than the other.it says on paragraph three in source one that\"The electoral college process consists of 538 electors.A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president\". This states that the president can get more electoral votes than the other and still get to be the president. i disagree with that i think it is not fare for the president who gets more qualified citizen votes. The citizens are the ones who need/want the presidnt why not give the citizens what they want and what they all vote for? You should give what the citizens want because hey are the ones who are voting for the new president or the same president one more time.it says in paragraph 10 source 2 \"under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a state electors.who in turn elect the president\".\n",

      "I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College.I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, \"Most states have a\n",
      "\n",
      "\"winner- take all\" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate.\" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases. The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong\", by Bradford Plummer, it states, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad\". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,\" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second reason of why our country must abolish the Electoral College is becuase it is a \"disaster factor\", as stated by Source 2. I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong\". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is becuase most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?\n",
      "\n",
      "In conculsion, \"It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality\", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a \"Disaster Factor\" or  causes many disruptions in our country.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachroninsm, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner\". (paragraph 15 in source 3) It's the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Some people don't know that. Though each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is rarely betrayed. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has rarely happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president anyways. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\n",

      "Dear State Senator, We should forget about the system of electorial college to vote for a president. It just isn't fair, reason why is beacause you are electing people to vote for the person who is trying to be president of the U.S although that doesnt mean that you both are voting for the same person that's trying to be president of the U.S. The electorial college system is corrupted and needs to stop being used to elect a president.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin, In the source 2 they state the following \"60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" Reasons why is because the electorial college is unfair it can make the person who had most of the votes lose because of the people who voted for the person to vote for a president choose the other runner up and make the person with the most votes actually lose. This is why people wish to have a direct election so they wont have to worry about their vote not going to the other runner up president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, The reason why the electorial college is wrong is because we dont have our own voice; but the slate of electors do which can be pretty much anybody. For example in the article \"What's wrong with the electorial college\" they state (If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors that pledged to Kerry) these elctors can be anyone and still doesn't have to be voting for him though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although, If the people can rebalence the electorial college system then it can be somewhat a good thing. I can see how it can be somewhat balenced already; stated in the first source \"the whole electorial college has a total of 538 electors. The president you wish to elect has to have a majority of 270 electorial votes in order to win.\" That means they need to have 270 more votes than the other president too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, so should the electorial college be abolished? unless people can find ways to limit the loosing president to come back with electoral votes, then yes this system should be banned.\n",

      "After much research, I have decided that the electoral college should not be kept. It is not completley fair, because the citizens think they're voting for their prefered candidate when really, they're voting for that candidate's electors. That means that if a candidate wins the votes of the citizens, he might not win the electoral college votes. This also means that he was not the president that the U.S. citizens wanted, but what the electoral voters wanted. In the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College\" they ask the question, \"Can voters sometimes controll whom their electors vote for?\" and they answer, \"Not always.\" This proves that the electoral college is not fair. Also, the electoral college shouldn't be kept because some electors will, \"refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please,\" says \"The Indifensible Electoral College\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" says \"The Indefensible Electoral College.\" That is more than half of the United States population, therefore we should get rid of it. I believe that we should abolish it along with that 60 percent, thatway when voting, it will be much more fair. Also, it will make choosing the president of the U.S. up to the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some may think that keeping the electoral college is good because, If there is a tie in the election, the electoral college can break it with their votes. Although this does help, it has only happened once, therefore proving to not be needed. Other reasons are because it gives certainty of an outcome, helps big states, and avoids run-off elections, but are also not that important.\n",

Our government says that it is by the people and for the people, but the electoral college is against this whole ideal.  The electoral college is unfair, undemocratic, and outdated.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, the electoral college is unfair because we aren't actually voting for the president, which is a constitutional right.  We are voting for a group of people, who by human nature, have their own opinions and agendas.  It is quite possible that they would go against us and vote differently like the 2000 election.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the electoral college is not democratic.  The people, who are supposed to decide who becomes president, are in fact, not deciding at all.  The voters are a piece of unnecessary government.  The popular vote should always be the way presidents are chosen according to the constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\n",
      "\n",

Maybe, in our country's beginning when people didn't have media or fast-traveling news, it may have been a good idea to have informed voters, but now, everyone has the chance to be informed.  Our country doesn't need an electoral college because we can think for ourselves.\n",

      "It has come to my, as well as many other's attention, that the presidential election is something that could potentially have disasterous outcomes. You, and many polititions like yourself, have been using a system called the Electoral College that people such as Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter have been suggesting to demolish for years now. Personally, I find it quite alarming that although this process has been with us for all of this time, we have found the flaws yet still continue to take the risks. This is not simply about picking a president anymore, this is about the freedom of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the Electoral College at face value seems like a good idea for choosing a winner. It seems to make sense that we would choose electors who the president trusts that would elect him president, but when you think about it, something feels rather off. First of all, the general public places their ballots in the appropriate box believing that they are voting for their ideal candidates. In reality, however, they are voting for their electors instead. Most people who vote are unaware of this factor, and the lack of information pertaining to it is unsettling. Not only that, but the electors are not chosen by the people. Does this not contridict \"By the people, for the people?\" Where exactly do these people fit in?\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the electors cannot always be trusted with voting for their respective candidates. This is something referred to as the disaster factor. While most who are picked by the candidate themself are trustworthy, electors are people who are not in office, therefore may not be as trusting. Electors are an uncertain factor and in some complex cases, even two slates for electors can be sent which could create a hectic mess. If you are going to vote for a president who you wish to win, and your vote goes to an elector that won't come through, it takes all of the power away from the people and places it right back into the state's hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider when pondering the validity of this process is the potential of a tie with electoral voting. In this case, the election would be in the power of the House of Representatives, and the representatives from each state would decide the winner. We have had many opportunities for a tie during the elections, one even being the difference of 5,559 in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii. The problem with this is the loss of power within the nation. Once again, the people will no longer have a say in the voting and the energy it took them to decide on a candidate and go out to vote will be for virtually nothing. The people will no longer be represented. If something like this were to happen to our country, surely people from every state would be outraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you may be thinking to yourself, why should I be worried? Sure, it is unlikely to get a tie in the electoral votes. However, something as huge as deciding the leader of this country should not have even a single flaw in it. Horrible and unexpected things happen everyday, why couldn't we get a tie as well? Now, the main problem with getting rid of the Electoral College is the possibility of run-off elections. In defense of this, the Electoral College is the main reason that we have run-off elections in the first place. It prevents people in certain areas from voting because they feel as if they will have no say in the final result. Even if people still voted for the fun of it, it was only because of chance or political preference. With an election by popular vote, the chances of a run-off election would be significantly lower as people would realize the power they had in deciding it.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you finish reading this, I ask you to consider all of the points I have made. I am certain that choosing to elect by popular vote would have more benefits than sticking to the old and flawed plan, the Electoral College. Endless proof points to the conclusion that this theory is correct, as the process of picking electors to elect the president is redundant and confusing. Finally, with all of the things that could go wrong, using a new system would be one step forward in making our nation even greater.\n",

I feel this way because a state can not controll how big or small it is, therefore giving it a small number of electoral votes lowers the importance of your vote If you live in a small place like rhode island, this makes people less interested in voting. If a president goes to his home state he usually gets the votes from there. so if a president was from texas then he will already be going on a great start.\n",

      "The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. (Source 1) However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. (Some state laws vary) (Source 1) If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that \"Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...\"(Source 3) In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have \"trust that is rarely betrayed\" (Source 3) you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. \"Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" (Source 2) If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\" (Source 2) In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote- basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. (Source 2)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College also follows the \"Winner-take-all\" method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though \"the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election\", as said by those who believe in the Electoral College (Source 3) what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.\n",

      "The process of the Electoral College has been a problem for many years and deserves to be abolished at its roots. The Electoral College should not be kept due to the fact that not many Americans comprehend this legal process, swing vote catastrophies and other problems, and its lack of democratic pedigree. You may wonder why someone like me is even writing about this or why I even care, but I care about what happens in my country's economy and government, and others should too.\n",
      "\n",
      "First thing's first: knowledge. From personal experiences and research, you may realize that the majority of Americans in 2014 couldn't describe to you what the process of the Electoral College even is. Each state is different in this process, just like each opinion is different about this topic. This is an immensely confusing subject to read about, especially when you're just an average person watching the news or reading an article online. Although, let's be real for a minute: its really difficult. The process consists of selecting the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for our President and Vice President. Also, in school curriculum across the country, you never really go into depth about the Electoral College unless you're taking a hardcore government class. In this case, the students are yet to be informed about the causes and effects of the Electoral College and the disasters it can cause in our economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's continue, shall we? The swing vote catastrophies, the worrying about who will be elected and whether or not they'll do a good job controlling our government, it's just not worth it. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election rather than the system that we use now. When citizens vote, they're basically voting for slates of electors, who then eventually vote to elect the President as well as the Vice President. The question is: Who are the electors? Who picks them? Are they responsible with the task at hand? The fact of the matter is that you really have no control over who the electors vote for. A \"faithless\" elector can vote for whomever they please, even if it isn't their party's candidate. This process is extremely unfair to voters across the country, and I doubt the phrase \"Life isn't fair\", a quote by my grandmother, would even apply to this discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously stated, the process of the Electoral College isn't the greatest of them all, nor is it fair to voters. I asked who the electors were, and who picks them... but where is the abundant democratic pedigree? To remind you, a democratic pedigree is the origin and history of something, especially when it is good or impressive to others. The Electoral College is outdated and irrational for our modern day concepts. This extensive process lacks alot of opinions, evidence, and background knowledge that is necessary when voting for candidates. On the other hand, there is usually a certainty of outcome in the election, and it avoids run-off elections which is pleasant to citizens who are for the Electoral College. What about the swing votes? What about the values?\n",

It's out of date, it's irrational, everybody in this case has a great chance of becoming president. That is no good, we do not need idiots running our country. Election by popular vote is the best way to go. You will have a certain outcome and votes will be fairly made. It benefits everybody. More than half of our population wants you guys to make the switch.\n",

      "The electoral college is not an up to date voting method. Our founduing fathers made it many years ago while writing the constitution. It is a long process of nonsense that has no advantages to us, the people. By popular vote, it's faster, simpler, and better. Popular vote is basically a group of qualified citizens voting for the president. Popular vote is the best way for people to directly voice their opinions by picking the president of their choice. If we use the Electoral college, the electors of our state may not deliever it properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 60 percent of voters prefer direct elections. Government officials such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others all thought we should abolish the electoral college. Many things are wrong with the electoral college, we don't directly vote for the president but for the slate of electors, who eventually vote for the president. It in no way benefits the people, they have no control over who the electors pick. In many cases, people have decided to not even vote because there was no hope.\n",

      "If there are greater chances of everybody being president, not only is there a fool running the country,he isn't going to worry about your interests or needs. If your own president won't help your interests, potential voters may be turned off. Isn't that horrible, to feel that our president isn't our president?  Knowing that our vote will have less of an efect, we won't want to vote. Voters in presedential elections are people who have something to say and actually want to express themselves. They are not the people who don't care and just vote to vote.\n",

According to the Gallup poll taken in 2000, over 60% of voters prefer a direct election, but Congress does nothing to change that. Keeping the Electoral college is unfair to the people of the United States. We should not keep the Elctoral College because, when Americans are voting, they are not voting for their president but for a slate of electors; the legislature is responsible for picking our electors not the people; and the process of a tie in the Electoral College is too unfair to the people.\n",

When we are voting for president, we are instead voting for a slate of electors; they in turn vote for the president. Voters can't control who the electors vote for, and this gives the a small say in voting for the president.\n",

Their votes can be the complete opposites of the people's vote. You could help us bring an end to the Electoral College.\n",

      "Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country; our President and Vice President.  We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights.  I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College has major flaws.  Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions.  Source A in paragraph 12 states, \"In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.\"  The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe.  It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly.  The other countries would take us as a joke; we would simply look like fools.  Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote.  Source B also in paragraph 12 says, \"Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\"  And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR (House of Representatives), where state delegations vote on the president.  And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million.  That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70.  That is a tremendous difference in population.  Don't let our country plummit into bad election.  If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.\n",

      "Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote.  With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right.  Source C says, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.  Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the \"swing\" states.\"  Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000.  Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina.  Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads.  Just as Source D states, \"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.\"  The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people.  What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress?  It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so \"without establishing a precedent.\"  What if it happened again?  Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush?  Thank that to the electoral college.  In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266.  This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.  And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders.  But why?\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, Source E states, \"So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does.\"  But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair.  The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do.  This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play.  It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California.  Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, \"They are the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\"  Once again, this statement is unfair.  This is favoritism.  This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more \"thoughtful\".  Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote.\n",

      "People want to make their own decisions.  It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities; we want to feel important.  With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote.  So it's official.  The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.  And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.  Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason.  It's fair.  There's only one thing I have to say to you.

      "Today I am asking for your favor of keepig the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This process now consists of the selection of the electors and meeting where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of votes by the congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, but only 270 of those votes are required to elect the president. I think that we should change the way that our citizens vote. I also think that we should update how the elections are run.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, we should change the way that our citizens vote. When we vote for a president we are actually just voting for that Elector. So there is a possibility that the Elector could vote for the opposite president and your vote basically not be put in. I think that our citizens should have enough rights that they dont have to have Elector to do the voting for them and we can all just vote for who we want. For instance, it could be just all politics and the Electors get paid to vote for a certain person and thats why most of the presidents who get elected get elected today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, We should update how the voting system works. Instead of it being 270 people out of 538, we should just have everyone one vote without Electors. Then everyone would have there say in the voting system and then they could just average it out or figure out the math of who won by percentage. For instance, take the number of all the people who voted for both presidents and take the number of one of the presidents and divide them by eachother and multiply it times 100. Then all the political stuff wouldnt happen because everyones vote counted. Maybe a change in the system would be a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, Bradford said that in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that vote would not have actually gone to Kennedy. So the Electors are not as reliable as everyone thought. Some Electors have also refused to to vote for there parties canidate. My honest opinion is to just change the Electoral College.\n",

      "In conclusion, I am writting to you Mr. Senator in hopes that you can fix the Electoral College and change the election to a popular vote. If this were to happen, it could make our citizens have a little more rights. We may also update our system a little bit so that the election voting is a little more accurate so that everyone gets to get there vote in.

      "Hello, my name is PROPER_NAME, a freshman at SCHOOL_NAME. It is much appreciated that you took time out of your busy schedule to read this. This letter is in regards to the Electoral College. There have been many ongoing diputes on whether or not we should keep the Electoral College in order to elect the President. It is felt that the Electoral College is not the way to go when it comes to voting for the President. The reasons being for this is that the Electoral College doesn't truly represent the people, and it doesn't allow everyone to know the true facts about each candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the Electoral College does not represent everyone truly. The Electoral College is overall risky. It is stated by Bradford Plumer from the passage,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Indefensible Electoral College...\"\n",
      "\n",
      ", that there were several incidents regarding corrupt electors whom did not fufill the popular vote of their state. He stated the incident in the 1960's, when the Louisiana legislature almost replaced Democratic electors, in order to not have the popular vote go to Kennedy. Electors can also choose who to vote for and have no care in who the general public votes for. Why risk giving your voice to people who are shady, untrustworthy, and won't care for your opinion? Furthermore, in the passage of\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What Is the Electoral College?\"\n",
      "\n",
      ", that most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system. However, in Maine and Nebraska, they use a system similar to \"proportional representation\". Why would the USA need this in order to choose a President? Why can't things all be the same?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the Electoral College does not give everyone a chance to know the candidates a little better. In the passage,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Defense of the Electoral College:...\"\n",
      "\n",
      ", he states that candidates focus more on swing states instead of all of the states in general. This strategy creates a problem for those who want to listen and get to know who the candidates are, but live in states that don't get visited. Which in turn, doesn't allow the general public to get to know who they are. Another problem is that when the popular vote is lost in a state, those who lost no longer have a say in the election. Why have your vote squandered to the majority when you can have a direct election that will always give you a voice in your country?\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, the Electoral College isn't the greatest way to pick a President. The Electoral College should be abolished for it does not always honestly voice the general public, and does not give everyone to the same opportunity to understand a candidate's motives. The Electoral College may give a clear winner and is less time-consuming, but are we working towards a speedy election? Or towards what the people want? Over 60 percent of registered voters prefer a direct election. Which would you prefer Mr. Rubio?\n",

The Electoral College is \"widely regarded as an anachronism\" a non-democratic  method of selecting a president that ought to be over ruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. This way it is fair. Did you know that when you vote for a presidential canidate you are really voting for a slate of electors?\n",

      "I believe that the United States should switch the precidential election process to popular vote. This is due to the fact that the U.S. has grown up, and as a people we need to vote for who we believe to be a great and capable leader for our country and we can't let other people vote for us. I think that the origanal thought behind the electoral college, compromise, was good in its time, but now is no longer the time for compromise, even if the electoral college has some right ideas, such as helping us choose the correct leader. I believe it is obvious to see we will fail and make mistakes as a result of choosing our own leaders,however it is more important and more benefitial that we make our own mistakes. We need to learn from them ourselves rather than to be stopped and pointed into a direction before getting the chance to decide which path we take. Like I said before the U.S. is a big boy, it's time to take the training wheels off.\n",
      "\n",
      "To support my idea that America should run off popular vote I shall point out some flaws with the idea the electoral college. The electoral college isn't equal. There are an unequal amount of people per state, and even though we divide power amongst those representatives equally there still isnt equal say among them as individuals, meaning a group of repsentatives from one state and one representative from another state could have the same power. How is that equal? Only in the sense that each state itself has the same amount of play in the election, but they don't, some states actually get looked over everytime the election happens. Another problem is that the representatives don't represent each person in the state or what they yern for in their leader, just the state itself. On top of the fact that the people aren't properly represented right, the people who are actually voting can just vote for who they like, which points to the fact that the electoral college has the possibility to be immoral and completely wrong.\n",

      "Presidential elections are closer than they seem, and your people have a complaint you need to hear. It involves the right to vote directly for a leader, and the ignoring of the vast majority. People have spoken in favor of omitting the Electoral College and sticking to what the people themselves deem acceptable for a president; not what one person decides for millions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It does not make sense for the voters of America not to vote directly for who they want to lead, represent, and protect their counrty. Especially if the people cannot even choose who the electors are! That is ignoring the 23rd Amendment all together.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do not get me wrong, I understand that some people are more comfortable with the Electoral College and they prefer to leave it in the hands of somebody politically intelligent and aware, but that usually means that those people need education and knowlege about the state of their country, and nned to be aware of how important their right to vote directly is. The Electoral College can go so wrong so fast and we need to go by what the majority millions say rather than the minorities with little to no knowlege. Us as Americans need to be educated when it comes to who is running in order for us to be able to say yes or no for ourselves- not depend on an unknown entity who might not even listen to what the people are saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "So many great people who were voted most popular and accepted amongst the people have actually lost presidency over the fact that the College had the upper hand. This is unfair to those in America who took the time to directly vote and who took the time to learn and watch debates that the opponent won due to the fact that thousands upon thousands did not speak for themselves and left it to somebody else blindly.\n",

      "In conclusion, Senator, I am asking you to think: is there ever really a happy turn out from ignoring the vast majority or doesn't that lead to an eventual uprising? Letting one speak for all is an unitelligent thought, we are a country where the people have power, have a voice, and are aware. Losing that is losing what makes us free.

This nation says it is all about the people and what's best for us; it even says so in the U.S. Constitution, \"We the people..\" And what the people want, and need, is a fair presidential election, which can be established by making the popular vote the deciding factor.\n",

      "When you think of any differentiation between two groups even back when you were a young child, how did you solve it? You vote. For example, say you and a group of friends are undecided on whether you want to go to the movies or the mall. So, you vote! Voting always has a fair outcome. It's simple. Whatever party has a higher number of votes wins and in this case becomes president. I certainly respect the idea and goal of the Electoral College, but it simply isn't quite effective. It does not make sense why we would get someone to be elected by people who have similar attributes to go represent them and vote for the presdent. It isn't very effective being that the voted Electoral College member could change their mind and vote for whomever they want instead of the candidate the people thought he/she was going to be voting for.\n",

All of this confusion could easily be eliminated if we eliminated the Electoral College.\n",

It eliminates the confusion some voters may get if they are unsure which elector feels similar to how they feel about each candidate. It eliminates the hastle of electing electors in the first place. It eliminates the uncertainty voters have about each electoral candidate, being that they could change their mind whenever they please.

This is unfair to the citizens of those states not being able to get a word in, let alone a simple acknowledgement of who they may be voting for.

However, the electoral college is flat out taking away our right to share our thoughts about the future leaders of the nation. The electoral college is irrational, and unfair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most basic reason why the electoral college is unfair to our country is because not everyone is fairly represented. For example, there are 55 representatives in California to represent 35 million voters. As you can see, it is an unfair ratio. It is impossible for the House's votes to reflect the views of the people in California. That also means that since each state only has one fianl vote, a state such as Wyoming, who has 500,000 voters, would have as much say as California, with 35 million. California has more people, and my making every state have equal representation, it is messing up representation in states like California.\n",

      "In the system we have today, it is very easy to have a dealocked election. In 1968, a mere 41,971 votes would have caused a major deadlock in the election. The same thing happened again in 1976, if 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii decided to vote differently. In both cases, and few thousand votes could have caused a serious disaster. History tends to repeat itself, so if the almost exact situation happened in the span of less than ten years, what makes you think it won't happen again?\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college creates an unfair system to gaining votes. In 2000, 17 states, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, who are home to some of the largest media markets, didn't even get the chance to see a campaign ad. If you were a canidate, wouldn't you want your ad to be seen in the some of the largest media markets? The canidates had already thought they won those states, which is a ignorant move to make. Because of the electoral college, and the unspoken rules that have been set in place about certain states views, the canidates missed a greatly helpful opprotunity to gain more votes.\n",

      "However, many might think that the electoral college is a good system because it gives a clear winner, and it makes the states have equal representation. If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner. The people want to have a say, not someone choosing for them.\n",

      "The Electoral college process consists of 538 electors. Each elector represents a state and they vote according to what the majority of the people favor. The Electoral college is a fair and honest way of electing the president because each individual has a voice in who is elected by voting for the state electors .\"You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors\"(Does the Electoral College Work?).

We need to continue with the Electoral college process despite a couple rarely occuring cons because all of the reasons to retain this fair system heavily outways the negative. There are five main arguements to continue the use of this justified system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason is \"certainty of outcome.\" A conflict over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is rare and less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. \" The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote\"(Does the Electoral College Work?). A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is also highly unlikely to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second argument is \"Everyone's president.\" \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal\"(Does the Electoral College Work?). This is so the residents of other regions don't feel deserted and that their votes don't count. Every president should have this desirable result so that he/she can be a successful president.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third main argument is \"Swing States.\" \"The winner-take-all mathod of awarding eletoral votes induces the canidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states....voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign\"(Does the Electoral College Work?). These electoral voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters and should be able to decide the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth reason to retain the Electoral College system is that \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states(by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution\"(Does the Electoral College Work?). A large state would get more attention than a small state and I think that this is fair because the larger states by population should get more votes because they contain more people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth and final reason that we as a nation should favor the Electoral College is because it \"avoids run-off elections.\"The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast\"(Does the Electoral College Work?). The Electoral College takes the huge pressure off of run-off elections and clearly produces a winner.\n",

      "I think we should change our voting method from the Electoral College to popular vote. The Electoral College consists of only 538 people. That's pretty much saying 538 people in America get to choose who our next president is. I think it should be set up by popular vote because their are millions of people in the U.S. that are able to vote, and each individual person's vote should count. The Electoral College is wrong because if there are about 100,000 people voting in a state, and 60,000 people vote for the Democratic side, and 40,000 votes for the Republican side, the Electoral College votes will go to the Democratic president and those other 40,000 Republicans would have voted for nothing. The Electoral College is one of the main reasons half of America doesn't vote. If one state wins the Republican electoral votes every single year, the Democrats will just stop voting. Then most of the Republicans will stop voting because they know they will win, and this will happen in every state until about 25% of America is voting, or possibly less. The popular vote gives evrybody a chance to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do think the Electoral College is better in some ways though. First of all, the Electoral College is full of people that know why they're voting. They know about their candidates and what their candidates are going to do for the U.S. Most of the population that votes in the popular vote don't know why they're voting. They vote simply on if somebody is black or white, Democratic or Republican. I bet if most of America's voters did some research on their candidates, the polls would be very different. I think another good thing about the Electoral College is that the bigger the population of a city, the more Electoral votes it has. If you win the Electoral Vote, you are most likely going to win the popular vote. And another plus side is that a candidate can not rely on a single region to win. He has to be in the favor of multiple regions in order to win the Election. These are some reasons against the thought of popular vote.\n",

We are the ones who know what we want and who we feel will be a great leader for our country.\n",
      "\n",
      "When citizens vote its known as the popular vote. Even though we vote every four years, its honestly a waste of time because the Electoral College doesnt care what we think. What matters to them is that they make the final decision on which president they think we care about more. Its not fair to us! We deserve a say in who we want to lead us in the right direction.\n",

      "The Electoral College has worked for many years but is becoming unfair to the average, everyday citizen.  I've recently analyzed the following articles: \"What is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even best-laid defences are wrong\" by Bradford Plumner, and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president\" by Richard A. Posner. The United States of America should change to a popular vote for president to benefit the nation as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we use the popular vote system, the nation as a overall unit will have some benefits in return. In, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong,\" by Bradford Plumner, it argues, \"voters vote not for a president, but for a slate of electors\". This statement is very much true. Citizens may think they vote for president, only to realize that he or she is chosen for them. The worst part of all, most don't know who the electors are. To strengthen, in, \"What is the Electoral College\", by the Office of the Federal Register, it claims, \"the meeting of the electors where they vote for president\". If this comes to be true, why even let citizens vote? Under this system, thier votes don't contribute to the presidential election. The presidential election should be by popular vote of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Electoral College does have it's benefits. In, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president\" by Richard A. Posner, it indicates, \"no voter's vote swings a national election\". This will allow the electors of each state to decide which president if better for the particular state. One voter's vote could choose the wrong president that harms the nation and doesn't help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear to see that both sides have their own pros and cons, but the nation should use the system of popular vote. This allows the people of each state to choose which president benefits them.\n",

      "Hello my name is PROPER_NAME and I am writing to you about our voting system. Many individuals are not content with the Electoral College and many are. You could see both sides, but that does not mean we should switch to election by popular vote. Here are a few reasons on why the Electoral College method is the way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "During election by popular vote there is a great chance that there could be a \"tie\". A tie would cause a great set back in the voting process due to the fact that there would have to be more votes cast or even longer campaigns. In the Electoral College system we don't have to worry about things like that happening. Yes, disputes are possible, but they are very rare. As stated in article three under the headline certainty of outcome, the reason for very few disputes is that the wnning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote. It is highly unlikely for a tie to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Article three line twenty-two reads \" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.\". One example of this is in 1968 Nixon only had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, but won the majority in the Electoral College. Another example is in 1992 when Clinton also only had 43 percent of popular vote but majority in the Electoral College. Source three line twenty-three states \" It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state..\". This is true but the Electoral College is still more efficient due to the fact there are rarely ever any ties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College eliminates the power of a large population, everything is equal. The winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in the toss up states are likely to be te most thoughtful, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. The case in the popular vote method is very different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over all you can see that the Electoral College method is the way to go. There are les bumps in the road and it is very efficient. There are rarely any ties, everything is fair, and it avoids run-off elections. We should not switch to the popular vote method.\n",

      "The Electoral College should be kept despite it's lack of giving people a chance to speak up. Although, the Electoral College is a \"non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.. it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential canidate you're actually voting for a state of electors.\" Yes this may be true but, have you thought that they created the Electoral College to help citizens live better? What if, someone with no education comes to vote and chooses someone who wants to take away government funds away from school's? Wouldn't that affect us? In other words, you want to ruin school's life by taking away funds and it doesn't really have to be school it can be anything just beacuse, you had no idea who you were voting for? The Electoral College does allow us to vote, but they make sure we aren't choosing someone who can affect the United States drasticly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potiential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, knowing that their vote will have no effect but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.\"(Source 3) Brings me back to one of my claims, yeah you do want to vote, but what if you don't have no education but you want to vote just for the hell of it? Without the Elecoral College your vote will count, as well as others and the group of senators won't be there to make sure you don't choose whomever and make a horrible decision. Although the Electoral College makes it seem like your vote won't count believe it or not, the Electoral College atually makes the most suitable decison for us, the people. Without the Electoral College, we'd have probably different world.. meaning they fix our choices dumb or not, they come together and they choose what's best for us whether we,the people have an effect on it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the fact, our voice may not be heard as loudly as the state of electors, we still have an impact, and without the Electoral College it may be a drastic impact. The Electoral College should be kept, and not changed into the most popular vote wins. You don't just vote once and hallieluja, there is a process and that's where the Electoral Colleg takes hand and make sure we choose someone mosly suitable. The Electoral College should be kept, it is very helpful despite it's cons...\n",

It changes the way we choose how the elections work. Even though it avoids certain things and helps others it should not be changed.\n",

      "The Electoral College makes the people basically choose one thing and then have the slate electors choose the president for them and that does not seem fair. In the source titled \"The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", it said \" Under the electoral college system,  voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" It seems unfair to have people waste their time voting for this and then to have something else make the decision. In lines 17 of the same source it states,\" Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state.

So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pulrality in states that he knows he will win.\" This is so that there is no winning just because of one place. Also in that same souerce in line 26 it states that,\" There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.... It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California.\" The Electoral college is a way to keep things fair.\n",

      "There are many issues concerning the Electoral College and whether to keep it or changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  The Electoral College is very important considering it has educated canadates.  The people do not understand that the United States has many uneducated people.  They do not realize that if there is no Electoral College, the people with education will vote to directly decide the president, but so will the uneducated people.  The Electoral College wants the best for our country and is trying to benifit the USA, not cause it harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the Electeral College is a benefit and means no harm, it does have its flaws.  Many people when they vote for example, a democratic representative, they expect the democratic representative to vote for the democratic canadate for president.  Unfortununtly, sometimes that is not the case.  The democratic representative will end up voting for the Republican canadate for president.  This issue occurs many times in the Electoral College which is why people are having second thoughts about the Electoral College and wanting to eliminate it so that they can directly vote for the president or vice president they want and think will improve our country more.\n",

In the second article, one of the arguments as to why the Electoral College should be abolished is incorrect due to the fact that not every state has the \"winner-takes-all\" system.

      "My name is PROPER_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME in LOCATION_NAME, and I am writing to you addressing a matter that I have witnessed being discussed, come every four years presidential election time: the Electoral College. I am in favor of abolishing the Electoral College and changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The method of electing our president should be changed to election by popular vote because the Electoral College is unfair, problematic, and does not represent the will of our citizens accurately.\n",

Though the focused campaigning is necessary in the process of the Electoral College, it would not be necessary if the voting system was by popular vote. This is unfair because it puts potential voters in the dark about what's going on. Also, Democrats in \"Republican\" states or vice versa cannot hope for them to help their preferred presidential candidate, as mentioned in\n",
      "\n",
      "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President .\n",

      "What Is the Electoral College states, we vote for electors to vote for the President and Vice President. According to\n",
      "\n",
      "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , \"[The electors]can be anyone not holding public office...sometimes the presidential candidates themselves.\" The electors may not vote for who the people wanted. An example of this would be in the presidential election of 1960. Also according to\n",
      "\n",
      "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , \"...segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors.\"(paragraph 11) If they had succeded, it would have meant a longer period of intense segregation and racism, which we are still fighting to this day. Another reason that the Electoral College is problematic is in a case of a tie in the electoral vote. Then, more steps are required to figure out who's president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the Electoral College does not represent the citizens of the United States accurately. Many reasons support this claim. I think political parties are similar to \"cliques\" in school. People in cliques act in a certain way, dress in a certain way, only think that how they do things is right, etc. Political parties are similar. If you pick a political party to identify as, you're either \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice\". You're either for something or against something. There's not really an in-between. In\n",

Posner says that \"Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...\"(paragraph 23). Presidential candidates that don't identify with a certain party don't have much of a chance to win at all, even if they might turn out to be what's best for our country. I don't think there should be a vote for \"political preference\", but that's another arguement. Voters should vote for who they want to represent their country with flexible decisions, not a set cookie-cutter description, like a clique in school.\n",

      "In conclusion, I believe we should abolish the Electoral College and put in place a new system of voting. The process of voting should be changed to the poplular vote because the Electoral College is unfair, uncertainly problematic, and an inaccurate form of representation. We all want what's best for the country, right? So, this is how I think we should make our country better. My voice may not be much, but it only takes one to start a movement.

I know that may use the Elecotoral Collage as a way to keep everyone calm but I think if they were to let the people vote they wouldn't have to be worried about us not being calm because that's us getting what we want and therefore why are we going to complain. I also consider the Electoral Collage electors high class. So in this case they are going to want to vote for the benefit of them, I think this is unfair to the lower-income families because if the electors choose a president that is going to want to take all the benefits away from lower-income families how are they going to live?

      "The \"winner takes all\" system we've been using doesn't work. Less power is essentially being given to the people, and, some are even being ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases such as Al Gore's, the people said yes, and the College said no. And, voters didn't like this. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore lost the race, \"over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now\", meaning, Mr. Senator, it's time for change. In addition, this system easily allows for a tie. In this event, the results of the race would be decided by the House of Representatives, which we all know would swiftly put in a vote for the Republican canidate. And, since the Senate has also been recently dominated by Republicans, they too would choose one of their own, resulting in two branches of the government dominated by one political party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, with this faulty system, many people are being ignored. As you may recall (or not), \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.\"(Source 2, Paragraph 13) [(Although not seeing the ads might not have been a bad thing. (I'm just kidding.)] Why is this important? Because the people need to see and meet their canidates, but due to the electoral collage, people are being ignored. If the majority of the votes are known to be going to one canidate or the other, they will most likely not be visited by either side, because whom that state's electoral votes are going to are essentially locked in. The only states that recieve any attention are the \"Swing states\" (Source 2, Paragraph 13) that are pretty equal on both sides and can be easily swayed to pick one canidate or the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only evidence to refute my claim would be that \"Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation\" (Source 1, Paragraph 7), which actually might work; however, this would require all the states to change their policies, which we all know won't happen very easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, Mr. Senator, the way things work is going to need to change, we are being ignored and elections are being thrown. If you don't help us change this, the power of electing the president is going to remain with our, faulty, college.\n",

      "According to the articles and arguements given I think the most effective way to get a premeire president for our nation is vote on the behalf of the Electoral College. In my view of the Electoral College has more experience aswell as having a sense of quality and values that they know can change the country.If we depend on the popular vote of the country,only in the favor of the people classes and opinions of the people, it may lead to presidents that cant maintain order of his or her country.Nonethless,the votes of both Electoral College and majority vote is basically as lucky as a flip of a coin,one side may lead to ultimate failure and the depression of a country the other may lead to momentous uprising of the country,in chosing the right leader of the country.Although, based on the criteria I just created is really puzzling your mind about what president is best I believe that the Electoral College may clear things up and make the best decision in favor of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the articles,the Electoral College does knows best because although they lack of democratic pedigree doesnt mean there wont be democrats in the whitehouse, because they have requirements of how to find the best fit no matter what party included.Even if they were unsupportive of the democrats Romney lossed as example of equality of parties on the College's choice.The articles also state that no popular votes determine the election of a president showing that although more than half of the population in the nation picks a candidate it wont matter unless that candidate gets a majority vot of the Electoral College aswell.Stating that the expierience of the College will prevail on the birth of a new president,no matter what party,no matter the odds of a popularity vote, the Electoral College is a perfect example of this nation's motto because they are truely a sign of equality between candidates that might become great presidents of our nation.\n",

      "Dear Mr. State Senator,\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been a citizen of the United States for my entire life, and through my studies, research, and personal experiences with the Electoral College system, I have come to the conclusion that the Electoral college system is not only an out of date way of casting a vote, but also an ineffective way of electing a president. I believe that the popular vote both directly reflects and accuretly shows which politician citizens have chosen will best lead our country. The Electoral College is merely a way for politicians to attempt to swing the vote in their favor by paying more attention to states that contain more electors. Politicians should be concerned about gaining the votes of individuals, regardless of how many Electoral College members their states contain.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is very little need for the electoral college even to exist at all. There is absolutely no point in having two ways for collecting the votes of citizens when all that the system requires is for one of the candidates to gather more votes than the other. Having the Electoral College does not help the voting process and therefore will only harm or make the process of electing a president ineffective. In many cases, the votes of the Electoral College go against what the popular votes want and tend to cause an unwanted politician to go into office. I am not the only citizen concerned about this system, there are people all across the United States who dislike the Electoral College and who see that it constantly gets in the way of electing a decent president into office.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been politicians, Chamber of Commerce members, and everyday citizens who have stood up aginst this awefull Electoral College and who have realized just how terrible and ineffective it is. Putting this system out of commission will be no easy task, but if enough citizens like myself write to their local, state, and federal congress members, change just might be possible. Though a group effort would be required to destroy this system, it would be extremely difficult to convince politicians and presidents that have been in office for years to destroy this College that allowed for them to go into office. It would also be exceptionally difficult to get all three branches of the United States government to destroy the Electoral College, afterall.. it would only take the president's veto to stop it from being removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are counter claims to mine that I'm sure you will recieve within your time in office, counter claims that you should'nt ignore. I think that you should look over all of the evidence, all of the facts, and all of the sources that you can inorder to form your opinion as to whether or not the Electoral College should stay, or it should be terminated. Some of the claims that you will recieve will not have much basis and will most likely state that the system has been in existence ever since the founding of the United States. These claims are not based on evidence of the system being correct or being fair, these calims are based on a fear of change. Change tends to scare people, especially when their power of voting may be altered due to a major change to the U.S. government. But over the past several decades alone, our country has undergone many wonderful changes and experiences that have positively affected its citizens and its laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of these changes include the desegregating of schools and the right for women to vote. These changes are extremely positive, just like the destroying of the Electoral College would be. It would have a positive impact on all of the country's citizens and would allow for the United States to show that it too can change and adapt for the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not writing this letter to you because i think that you can single handidly change the voting system of the United States, I am writing this letter to you because I have faith that you can help change the opinion of your fellow politicians and State leaders. I hope that you use the facts and research that I have presented to you today and continue to gather more evidence on the Electoral College system and why it is holding back our country from properly electing its presidents.\n",

      "I would like to make a request. Please abandon the idea of the electoral collage. thats a childs game. It is not fair game. The electoral collage sends a certain number of electors to represent a state. Why not let an individual person represent his or her self? it is obsurd that in Wyoming, a state of 500,000 voters, only get 55 represenntitives. It is with great agrivation that i ask you to make this change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I would like to state that the electoral collage is outdated and irrational. There is no need for this great mess. The oposition states that the electoral collage is a nessesity for organization. I personally beg to differ. I feel that voting for presidents would be more organized if we counted each individual vote from each individual person. I no longer want to vote for a slate of representitives when it comes time to vote for another president.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, did you know that there were four presidents that had the mentality to abolish the electoral collage? These presidents, as stated in The Indefensible electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradford Plumer, were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. As well as the U.S. chamber of commerce and the AFL-CIO. they were all in favor of abolishing this horrid electoral collage! AL Gore lost the presidency because of the electoral collage. He had 60% popularity vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, I am ashamed to say that each state has its own amount of representitives. We should have a universal number of representitives for each state because it is unfair that a president can lose a presidential election because a state that had an increaced amount of representitives ran against them. I ask you to please vote against the electoral collage for the following three reasons:\n",

      "The representitives dont amount to the number of individuals that voted.\n",

      "I'm writing to you today regarding my concerns on our voting method for the president of the United States. Although we've been voting by the electoral college for how ever many years, I don't think it is the most efficient and fair way of voting. Our Chamber of Commerce, former vice president Richard Nixon and many more would have to agree with me when I say that abolishing the electoral college could only be beneficial to us. The electoral college system is unfair, confusing and forces people to compromise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college is unfair, being that voters don't always control who their electors vote for, opposed to election by popular vote. One reason why America strives is the fact that we are a democracy, where every one gets a say and we are not ruled by a dictators or communist. The electoral college in no way follows our democratic system, the people are not voting for our president our electors are the ones voting for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only is the electoral college unfair but it is also confusing. For new voters they may be confused by the eletoral college. New voters may wonder why can't I just vote for the candidate I most prefer. Think about it like this, in the electoral college the electors are the middle man. Why not cut the middle man out? And as a result make the voting system much simpler.\n",

      "People may agrue that the electoral college system stops a majority vote. So let's say, you're a democrat living in the state of Texas with the electoral college system in place. You might as well not vote for an elector cause the majority of the people in texas are going to vote for the republican elector. On the other hand, there is the election by popular vote, gives everyone a say in whom they'd like to vote for. There is always the possibility of the disater factor.\n",

      "I think the Electoral College should be changed to popular vote because we have a lot of close presedential race nowadays. We also need to change the voting system because candidates are focusing on the \"swing states\" instead of all the states in the U.S.A. We also have the problem where one candidate can win the Electoral College and the other candidate can win the popular vote. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes. If we get rid of the Electoral College then we won't have to deal with people stressing about the candidate who should've won and the candidate who actually won.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would rather have my vote be counted towards the president that I picked instead of electors who might pick that person. If I live in a democratic state and I'm Republican, then my vote is most likely not going to count because the electors are going to vote for the other president since the state is known to be a democratic state. Then we wonder why people don't vote; it's mostly because they know which candidate is going to win that state. With popular vote , nobody knows who will win the presidency because all 50 states have equal representation. No one state will be greater than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to paragraph 9  \"A Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after AL Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election,\" this proves that people are already thinking about having the direct election rather than the Electoral College.\n",

Ponser, I will eleborate on this subject. Now, since I am only fourteen, I do not claim to have all knowledge and be an expert on this method of voting, but it is not the way to choose our country's leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College is a compromise between who the people of America chose and who Congress has chosen. This is an incorrect method of selecting the President. The Constitution states that we the people have the choice to select our government; not Congress. Yes, the Constitution's founding fathers also established the Electoral College, but it is a thing of the past. As Richard A. Ponser writes, an \"anchorism\" (In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 1), if you will. Moreover, the Electoral College does not belong in this day and age; it is something that is out-dated and in need of replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College also does not allow citizens to exersize their right to vote for their President, since Congress also has their say in the matter. The voting process was created for the citizens; not the people who are in the government. In fact, Bradford Plumer states that \"over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" (The Indefensible Electoral College, par. 1) This process of voting for President is undesired and despised my many people, by over half of the voters in America. The Office of the Federal Register writes that the Electoral College is \"a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens.\" Why does Congress have any sort of influence or say in this matter? The people choose their government; not the governemt itself!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, the Electoral College is something that should not be used, by I can see the point of its purpose. The popular vote of the citizens can be infulenced by others, or advertisements and propoganda from political parties. Some voters are biased and overlook the negative things of the candidates because they do not wish to believe that this person does not support or believe everything they do. The Electoral College helps to balance that out. \"No region... has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" (In Defense of the Electoral College, par.  5) Richard A. Ponser asserts this in his article, as well as the fact that no region or place has any reason to go about \"increasing his plurality\" (par. 5) to make sure that a candidate will win. The Electoral College prevents this, resulting in a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "To come to a conclusion, I have stated that the Electoral College is not a method that should be used to choose the President of the United States. It is out-dated and does not allow citizens to choose the leader of their country. However, is balances out the popular vote and the Congress's vote.\n",

      "The electoral college is unfair to the voters voting for the president and other candidiates. Using the \"Winner-Take-All\" system, the voters know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the states also. All because they can't spend time in states.\n",

Don't forget that there is the off chance that those electors won the stateside election, they would go to Congress and John Kerry would get 34 electoral votes but, who are they electors? I'll tell you, they can be anyone not holding public office.\n",

      "Those sates would include, Rhode Island, and South Carolina. Also, voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign add. Not one, and the electoral college has the power to make things worse than what happened in 2000.\n",

      "Dear, To whom ever it may concern I here am writing this this letter to tell you guys about the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electorals votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Amendmentof the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College.\n",

      "I think that the Electoral College is a decent way to vote for president. But is it really the best way? Though the Electoral College elects presidents in a way favored by many, it doesn't allow for people to directly vote for the president. Because of that, the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to election by popular vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voting by Electoral College can make things unfair. As stated in the article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College\", \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president\" (Source 2). That statement basically says that when a voter goes to vote, they aren't voting for the president, but for someone to go and vote for them. Also, who exactly are the people we go and let vote for the person leading our country? According to the article, \"Electors can be anyone not holding public office\" (Source 2). The people who go and vote can't control who these electors vote for. That's just another way that the Electoral College can be unfair to the voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with being unfair to the voters, the Electoral College can also be unfair to other people as well, for example, the canidates actually running for president. In an article that is for the Electoral College, it states that, \"...the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people\" (Source 3). Does this mean that the Electoral College may have been a good system a while ago, and maybe not as good this day in age? Yes, it does. Also, in the article, it states, \"...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote\" (Source 3). That being said, there is always a chance that the result of an election will not be what the country as a whole wants, but what the electors want.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, the Electoral College is a very interesting proccess that everyone should know about. But I believe that the Electoral College should be a process that stays in textbooks to be learned about, not to actually be used. The Electoral College should be gone and be changed to election of popular vote. After all, the Preamble to the Constitution says, \"We the people\", not \"We the electors\".\n",

Some of the reasons are so that we can vote and keep all of congress and our President in order. We need this mainly for voting, sometimes I can admit that not everything this Electorial College does I agree with. But for the U.S. reasons for staying as one we need this more then ever so that we can vote and so that we can have president and all our different congress people too.\n",

      "But like I said at the top that there are some cons to this agrument, if we should or shouldn't have the Electorial College. Some things that bring conflict to this whole process is that some peoples votes wont have effect in the voting for who becomes president next or not. All votes should count, because if they know that why should we even vote if some peoples don't count. It is like we want that president who ever it is at that time to win and no votes even matter.

      "Goodmoring senator before I start , I would like to ask how are you doing and how's your family. I hope everybody health is great and family problems. Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? The presidential election most have a \"winner-take-all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a \"Certificate of Ascertainment\". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the \"swing\" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!\n",

There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.

      "I am righting to you today about about a very important topic, I am here to tell you that I believe we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. There are many reasons why we should do this transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "First reason, why we should change to election by popular vote is because Electoral College is very unfair to the the people running for presdient, and the people voting. Its unfair mostley because of the winner-take-all system in each state. This system is ridicolus because a lot of candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. I know a lot of crazy systems like this are making people not want to vote anymore, which is not good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great reason, why we should change from the Electoral College to election by popular vote is because of how out of date and irrational the Electoral College actually is. Us the people of the United States don't even get to vote for our next president directly, you help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last reason, why we should change over to election by popular vote is because of the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. The way the Electoral College handles ties is unprofessional to many, becasue all they do is throw the election to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Conclusion, As you can see Mr. Senator Me and many others would really enjoy if the Electoral College was changed to election by popular vote. The reason being is because of how the Electoral College is unfair and irrational.\n",

      "So I think you should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.Because if you elect a president by slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Thats not fare to the other person that was running, because what if the other person was winning and they lose because the slate of electors elect the person that was losing. For example Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\n",

To me it seems senseless to be voting for a slate of electors rather than a president. Also, anyone not in office can be an elector so that means they may not be the best person to be representing your vote. The electors may only vote for who they want rather than go with the vote of the people which is why I beleive the president should be elected by popular vote. This would also mean there would never be a tie. In the event of a tie the House of Representatives would take the vote. So the representative of Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have the same power of as the representative of California, representing 35 million voters. it should be quite clear why popular vote would make more sense.

      "Dear Mr. Senator, there is a huge concern over who's vote is the real vote, Americas, or the Electoral College \"Your vote counts\" is what the citizens of America always hear when it is finally time to vote. But does it really count the way that it should? The tuesday after the first monday in November, everyone is going crazy lining up outside of the voting polls and waiting to make their vote count for who they want their new president to be. But are they really voting for a President or a state of electors? Whats the point of even putting in our vote if the Electoral College is gonna take over and vote for who they want. It makes no sense at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is completely understood that they use the peoples votes  for who they pledged on but that really has no purpose. Instead of having the people of America vote then why don't we just have the Electoral College be the only people to vote? So basically when the people of America go and vote they are not voting for any president at all. Instead they are voting for Democratic and Republican electors. That completely overrides the whole purpose for the Presidential election.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2002, Al Gore lost the election due to the Electoral College. He had more individual votes but George Bush had more electoral votes. That proves that many peoples vote doesnt count. If more people voted for Gore thats what the people of America wanted and there was proof. So it was very unfair how Bush won because of electoral votes. Why do the people of America even vote if things like that may happen, how come they encourage us to vote, why not just let the Electoral College do all the voting for who they preffer? If the people cant get what they want then why do we even vote for it?\n",
      "\n",
      "The only real reason that the people are to vote is to be played. America is being fooled by thinking that their vote does something when really it does nothing at all. If Bush won because of the Electoral College and not individual votes why did the people even vote?  If noone were to vote then we would still have a president because, the Electoral College would just vote for who they wanted instead right? So why must America vote? If our votes count then why would we need an Electoral College to assist in the presidential election? America should be able to get who they want not who the Electoral College wants. So the question usually asked should not be, \"Did you vote\" but instead, \"Did the Electoral College vote\"?\n",

      "I would like to argue with your decision of getting rid of the electoral college. I would like to argue with you because the Electoral college is a piece of history, we could some problems if we keep the electoral college, but there are a bit of problems with this voting system. So Senator this is my letter that i want you to read so you can rethink the decision of getting rid of the Electoral college.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral college is a voting system that depends on the popular votes to see who gets the electoral votes in the president race. The founding fathers established the electoral college in the constitution, which means this voting system has been with this country since the beginning of the United States. To get rid of the Electoral college is like getting rid of a piece of this country. The founding fathers made the electoral college so the president and vice president could get chosen. There are five hundred and thirty eight electoral votes possible to get. To win presidency you must have two hundred and seventy electoral votes. These votes are one of the most important things. So I want you Senator to imagine getting rid of a piece of the constitution, just imagine ripping a little piece off. Guess what you can't because the constitution is to important to this country to take anything off of it. This is one reason Senator that the electoral college should not be disbanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College has the ability to get rid off problems such as avoiding run off elections, which means that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also has swing states, which means the people in the state pay close attention to what the candidates say and vote for who they feel should win so that the winner take all method isn't in effect. A good example of a run-off election is the elections of Richard Nixon and Bill clinton. Both of these presidents had forty three percent of the populare votes, but dominated in the electoral votes. A good example of a winner take all method is the election of 2012 where the candidates focused on the voters in the toss up states or the states that listen and vote for who they think is better. Another example of a run-off election is if a candidate does not win a majority of the votes vast than the presidential election would be greatly complicated. The complication is then reduced by the Electoral College, which chooses a winner. The Electoral College can save a lot of things for just a voting system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Electoral College helps a lot there is a couple problems with it. When you vote you vote for who you want to vote for, but when that vote gets put in the Electoral College doesn't have to put there vote to who you voted for. The Electoral College is also unfair to voters because of the winner take all system. During the 2000 campaign some states didn't even get to see their candidates. Some states didn't even get to see a ad on tv for their candidates. The Electoral College is also known as the disaster factor because of the crisis in the election of 2000. The electors are chosen by the legislatures and the electors could always defy the will of the people. The Electoral College can be fixed, so don't take it way that way it can be fixed and arranged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College is good because it keeps us away from problems, even though it has some, and is a part of our history. This whole letter is to explain why you the senator should not take the electoral college away. I have to say it has problems, but those problems can be fixed by some simple solution.\n",

      "Many people go back and forth whether or not to keep the Electoral College or switching to popular vote to decide on who our President of the United States will be. The Electoral College just isn't a fair way in deciding who the President will be. Just because that canident won the Electoral College and not the most popular vote out of the whole country, does not mean that should be President.\n",
      "\n",
      "The picture provided in source 3 shows a map of the \"breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state.\" Throughout the map you can clearly see that each state does not have the same number of electoral votes as all the rest. When people go out to elect the President they have to understand that they might not be in control of that vote honestly counting. We basically aren't choosing the President we want. We are choosing the electors for that President who will be voting for you and the state. It's sad to see that even if a President does win the popular vote out of the whole country that they still, may not become President because of the Electroal College. It even says in source 2 paragraph 9 \"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" If more people are against the Electoral College then there must be a change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with people feeling as if their vote doesn't matter, there could be a \"disaster factor.\" A disaster factor is when you vote for the candidates electors that then go and vote for the President of the opposite that you wanted. Yes is happens \"rarely\" but it still has happened. It says in source 2 \"back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors withnew electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.\" They were going to do this so that the popular vote whould not be counted for Kennedy. People have to keep in mind that if we vote for who we want as the President we are voting for electors that at any point in the election can change their mind and not vote for who you originally voted for. If electors do, do this then we have no control over it. It's like we've been told that our opinion doesn't matter or count in our country that is supposed to be free, we also have rights that prove our voice is allowed to be heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand like stated in source 3 people may argued that \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee\" but then it goes further on to say \"it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" That statement proves that it is unfair and not right not just to the candidate but to the people who overall voted for them. It also says in source 3 that \"no region (Soth Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" But it sure does play a big role in deciding whether or not the President you want to win, will win or not. Also because of states being more popular than other states the Electoral College might as well say that those states are better than others, which is not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Electoral College voting method should be changed to popular vote. It will make people feel like their vote actually matters and by having a popular vote the voting throughout the whole country would be more accurate than the Electral College way. With the amount of electoral votes given to each state it isn't fair to say that each state is even. Also with the chance of a disaster factor happening, people would feel more comfortable with knowing once their vote is in it will stay that way and not be changed by something that they can't control, especially by someone else. Our voting method must change and change quick.\n",

I am writing you this letter saying that I want to change ther election by popular vote for the president of the United States because under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate elector, who then turn elect the president. Sometimes the electors vote but the voters cant always control who they vote for. Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy so that the popular vote for Kennedy wouldnt have acutally gone to Kennedy. Electors have often occasionally refused to vote for their partys canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. I think that the electoral college is unfair to voters. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. They said the Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachornsim. Probably changing to election by popular vote it would be more fair to the people than the electoral college.

      "I think choosing to change to election by popular vote would be more in my opinion because it'll be more fair and they vote for whoever they want and the one with the most popular vote wins, unlike the electoral college that seems unfair to me because when you vote it goes to the electors and the elector then goes and chooses who he wants to pick and he may pick a wrong candidate. But i believe if choosing to change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States it would be more fair to the people because they could see by the popular vote.

      "The system of Electoral College is one of much controversy as to what to do with it. Keep it or toss it? 'Tis the question. According to an excerpt of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, a Gallup poll taken in 2000, says that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the one we have now. Apparently, the electoral college has failed us throughout the years because of the unfairness it can sometimes have. One example being presidential candidate, Al Gore, who was cheated out of his postion by the electoral college. The electoral college has caused \"close election(s) in which the popular vote winner can again lose the presidency\". (Source 2.9)\n",
      "\n",
      "On the contrary, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, an excerpt by Richard A. Posner, has a point when it says that when the people vote for the President they're actually voting for a slate of electors, thus each party votes for the electors who are trusted to vote for the right nominee. It says that very rarely has this trust been betrayed, only happening in 2000, when Gore was hijacked of his position, and centuries earlier in 1888. (Source 3.15-16)\n",

      "So to keep or toss the Electoral College? 'Tis the question indeed, but the Electoral College has been proven to operate well enough for everyone for the past few centuries since the Constitution was made and the presidents were elected. It was said to fail us in the future but through 44 presidents it has only failed us a few times. Maybe we don't need to see the Electoral College in a black and white, keep it or toss it fashion but think to shape it so the system works better and in favor of the people with fewer kinks.\n",

      "Should the electoral college process be demolished? Many would say no way PROPER_NAME, but I strongly consider the electoral college process should be demolished. I believe this because I think the citizens of the U.S. should be able to vote for their favored presidential candidate directly. In reality, voters are not really voting for their presidential candidate, they are voting for a slate of voters. Below are my main reasons for why I am in favor of demolishing this electoral college\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, let's get something straight, citizens who regularly vote in the presidential election are not really voting for their desired presidential candidate. All fifty of the U.S. states are given a certain amount of electoral votes. As the electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, it's not fit for the present anymore. According to the third source, the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaing that the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winn er.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are five reasons why the electoral college has not been demolished yet,\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainty of outcome\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone's President\n",

      "Avoid Run-Off Elections these are the reasons ehy the electoral college has not been demolished even though it is highly resented in the U.S.A.\n",
      "\n",
      "In continuation, people who vote should be able to directly vote for who they are in favor of winnning the presidency. That basically means whoever's name was checked off on their voting card should have been their pick to win the election, not for another sllate of voters who do the voting for them, that's not having a voice. The electoral college method of selecting the president may turn of potential voters for a candidatr who has no hope of carrying their state. For example, Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, I urge that the electoral college process should be outruled. Because people who don't support their state, their vote won't matter until this electoral college process is outruled. It is important that all Americans vote count in a election of any kind. They should be able to vote for whoever they want directly, not for electoral, but for the popular vote. Not to vote for a slate of voters who elect the president themselves. Now, again, should the electoral college process really be demolished?\n",

      "The electoral college system is archane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely over-looked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, canidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediatly shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's super-power? One that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote- a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, old-fashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the electoral college (in addition to putting down the voter) has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968- these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World- the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representitives- without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?\n",

      "I have very mixed feelings about the whole Electoral College or regular people voters. Honestly there are very good points / arguments for both sides. You could possibly say that the Electoral College is a \"cheat\" or you could also say that the people voting isn't the best idea based on immaturity / judgment people give.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the start everyone has learned how to play fair in the game and what a cheater is, I believe that the voting of a president is similar. Remember when you where a kid - or watching your kids - playing games, laughing, and having a good time, then all of a sudden, uh-oh, some one is being accused of lying or cheating. This is why I argue that there shouldn't be an Electoral College, the state can change the people in the Electoral College and start what is considered the disaster factor, in 1960 this occured in order to vote against John F. Kennedy. Although many members of the Electoral Collage are honest and refuse to oppose another canadet, many also will.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also believe that the Electoral College will do and has done what is right for the United States. If we did change the election to popular vote then I garentee there would be more conflict and the country would start to fall apart. Honestly though, the legal voting age is 18, and teachers, parents, peers, and even commercials are encouraging them to vote, at 18 you may be a legal adult, but in reality most 18 year olds are still in High School or just getting out of. With all the influence and responsibility going to there heads these \"adults\" are obviously going to vote as soon as possible. Not even just 18 year olds, but also actual adults will vote just to vote. Now, tell me this, do you really want the leader of your country chosen by the people? It's a natural thing that people will pick someone just because of there skin color or religion, people judge by instinct, I know I wouldn't want the president to be chosen just because if he was Catholic or Christian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reasonof self conflict I have for the Electoral College is the time spand it has been. Times are always changing, from new electronics, maturity levels, and all around peope, so why have an Electoral college when it was made so long ago? Doesn't it seem very out dated? Then again, we have had it for so long and it helps many difficulties with the voting process, including ties. For example, what if there was no Electoral College and after all the people voted and there was a tie, what would we do?\n",

People who change their vote onto the president they aren't being representing on again.\n",

Totally taking over the right to vote for president freely as a nation sorta thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "More or less our vote does matter. In 2012 the popular vote was very close in Florida; even so Obama won the vote and got 29 electoral votes. If he represented Wyoming instead of Florida he would have got only 3 electoral votes because of the Democratic and Repubilic electors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Larger states get the more attention tho, and when the president represents the larger state that votes toward his kind of Republic or Democrat field it is more likely that he will win of popular vote.

      "Dear Senator, I feel the need to bring the Electoral College to your attention. I think keeping the Electoral College is not a good way to vote for the president of the United States. It's an unfair way to vote. 538 electors and the majority of 270 votes to elect the president seems to have problems every time. If the person running for office has more votes it obviously means they want that person to win the election. So why go around that process and change everything and make it more difficult for the person to win? People all over keep trying to change things with voting but don't have a choice. When they vote for someone in office it doesn't equal a whole percent which actually goes towards whether or not they will or will not be president. Thanks to the Electoral College it makes things harder. Thats's why people don't like to vote. So Senator, please think about getting rid of the Electoral College it's fair that the person with the most votes should win because if everyone voted for them they wanted that person to win. That's more fair than popular votes and then what the other 538 people have to say.\n",

      "I think it would be best to keep the Electoral College process instead of changing it to popular demand. The reason why I think that is because I would rather have political experts who study the two candidates based on the speeches they give prior to election day make the decision on who should be our president rather than random voters across the United States. I personally think that if we keep the whole Electoral College process our country will improve a lot. On the other hand, if we were to use the popular demand process than voters could discriminate against one candidate and choose the other one. On top of that when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of candidates. So even if one candidate gets picked over the other, their is still a lot of voting left to be done. I think the Electoral College process would be better for the United States as a whole. I also think if we were to use the Electoral College process it would decrease a lot of arguments and controversy across the United States. If we were to use the popular demand process their could easily end up being a tie, where as if we were to use the Electoral College process they judges could come to an agreement as to who won the election entirely. Also, if we were to use the Electoral College process their would be no such thing as a run-off election anymore. Usually when you use the popular demand process one state might get more attention then another state, where as Electoral College process will treat each and every state equally. When using the Electoral College process it would be easier to count up the votes because you only have so many voters, where as with the popular demand process there would have to be over 2 million votes counted up. There are many other reasons why the Electoral College should be used over the popular demand process. So it shouldnt be hard for you to decide on what process should be used during the Presidential elections. That is why I think the Electoral College process should be used. I hope i made your decision a little easier then it was before.\n",

And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college is unfair in many ways, this one however can be seen as minor. The electoral college gives an easier way to get  tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem. I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote.\n",

This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president.\n",

Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it's good to go an extra step, it shouldn't go when not needed. This to me is most important because I could argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument.\n",

      "My name is PROPER_NAME. It would be beneficial to keep the electorial college because it is in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congree and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, if we used just popular vote candidtates would just go to bigger states like Florida, California, Texas, and Georgia and win the popular vote, and lastely without the electorial college there would be a greater chance of a dispute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five reasons to keep the electiorial college are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Certainty of Outcome\n",
      "\n",
      "A dispute over the outcome of an Electorial College vote is possible but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote because the winning candidate's share of the Electorial College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.\n",

      "Almost all states award electorial votes on a winner take all bases.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In the 2012 election Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electorial vote, but only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Althought a tie in the electorial vote is possible because there is an even 538 votes it is highly unlikely.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Everyone's President\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electorial College requires a presidential candidater to have a trans-regianal appeal, what this means is that no regian has enough electorial votes to elect a president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore a president with only one regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the president could win the electorial vote with just one regions votes the other regians would feel disenfranchised and feel that the president wouldn't care about what they want or need.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Swing States\n",
      "\n",
      "The winner-take-akk method of awarding electorial votes makes candidates focus on states called swing states.\n",
      "\n",
      "These voters in the swing states are most likely to bve the most thoughtful voters and they are the ones that decide most elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of a swing state is Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "Florida always changes between Republican and Democrat and having 29 electoirial votes that is a big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Big States\n",
      "\n",
      "The electorial College gives back some of the weight in big states that they lose in the senate where every state has only 2 representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Florida is also a big state having 29 electorial votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes Florida even more attractive to candidates to visit because it is both a swing state and a big state.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Avoid Run-Off Elections\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electorial College avoids a problem in which no candidate receives a majority of the vots cast.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electorial College takes away that complication by providing a clear winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastley if popular vote was used candidates wouldn't have to go to a variety of states, they could go to the same big states including California, Florida, Texas, Georgia, and Washington.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just winning the majority of these states they could win the whole election.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would cause smaller states like Ohia, North and South Dakota, and Michigan to not be a piece of the election as much because of their low population.\n",

      "I agrue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, for this reason it wouldhave to be the fact that it is a much easier method electing presidental canditates. At times I know it can be unfair to most of the voters around the nation but this way is more easier than it might already seem. Instead of the people voting for which they think is the new president, it would be more likely the electors who elect the president for the state. These slate of electors are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. For some states it wouldn't be just random it be either democratic, or republicians. When having the electors it wouldbe possible to be the winner of the electoral vote but not the national popular vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the president's chance of winning having an Electoral College will exceed his share of popular vote. An example would be the election backin 2012, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared 6to what Romeny had because most of the states awarded the eletoral votes on the winner-take-all basis, can get a chance of having victory in winning the electoral vote. But there would be a possible chance of having a tie against the states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason for this debate would have to be the reason that the candidates themseveles have to get the regional appeal from the states. For Romeny that gave him an opporunity but had little to offer. He no electoral votes in the states that he knowshe will win. For this unsuccessful result, Romeny only had regional appeal there for he was less likely to successed in the southern region. For other states that felt as if their votes didn't count, so there for assumed that Romeny had little interest, leading to the thought of an unlawful candidate. Swing states on the other hand have a chance of making it. The reason for that being is voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they are going to decide the election. On avergae they are are thought of as the most thoughtful voters (the result is that they have recieved more information and attention from the candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electoral Colleges balance the weight in political balance that larger states lose virtue of the Senate. For Obama he won that vote based on the amount of electoral votes he recieved from Florida was 29. Also 3 from the state of Wyoming. In other reasons, larger states recieve the most attention from the candidates than the small states do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the information I have provided you in this statement, I will concluded that sometimes this method can be a little complicated to most voters in the U.S. For the reason is that most of the smaller states remain unseen by the candidates of the elections but sometimesend up winning thepopluar vote for the candidate they chose.

I am writing to you because it is in our best interest to abolish the Electoral College and change election to popular vote for the next presidential election. The reasons we should make this change is because the Electoral College is unfair for voters, also a disaster waiting to happen and the popular voting system bring so many more benefits and opportunities for the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral system simply takes away the people's say on who they think the best candidate is. It is simply unfair for the voters. In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a \"winner-take-all\" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states.\n",
      "\n",
      "In source two, Bradford Plumer mentions the single best argument against the Electoral College, which he calls the \"disaster factor\". Voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This means that voters dont really have control on who they vote for, as mentioned before. The Electors can defy the will of the people, the only reason people vote, in this system, is to \"sway the opinion\". This is known as the \"disaster factor\", the electors defying the will of the people. Another problem with this system is that if there is a tie, it is definately out of the peoples choice. The decision is left to the House Of Representatives. The Electoral College is a disaster waiting to happen, like a bomb ticking, at some point in time, it will explode.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of switching to popular vote really pays off. With popular vote, these issues adressed would not be a problem at all, such as the unfairness to voters, the disasters awaiting to happen with the Electoral College. The only downside to this is that it will take a little longer to count the votes and finalize the election, but it is worth it. All voters would be at peace of mind knowing that their vote actually counted for something. In my opinion, this is the best choice and option out there. We need to get rid of the Electoral College because it brings us no good at all. We could finally stop worrying about the timer!\n",

      "I personally think that the electoral college should not be abolished. Yes some things are unfair for example : voters don't vote for the president directly and the fact that voters can't always control whom their electors vote for . That's life though , life is unfair to everyone . Instead of shutting the whole electoral college down , they should try to improve it so the voters can be satisfied . The electoral college plays a big part in the voting process. Although there are many unfair things the electoral college helps. The president should be elected by the electors because they know more than the amount of people who voted for them so they could elect the president. I believe that the voting process is not as simple as it looks , it's more complicated then that , it might seem simple to us but complicated to others. The voting process would be harder without the electoral college and the citizens won't have anyone or anything to guide them. A lot of us don't really know about politics , the real side of the candidate shows when he become the president , the electors can already start to see the real side of the candidate even though he's not the president. The citizens need a group of people to guide them in the right direction so they won't regret the choices that they made . Yes the electoral college has a few negative things but it's for the best. In my opinion electoral college should continue because overall this process helps a lot. Instead of stating the wrong facts about the electoral college , we should all try to make it a better process so all the people who think it's unfair think otherwise.\n",

      "Over the course of American history the US has always had an Electoral College, which was designed for untrustworthy ballot counting during the 18th century. Today the world is in the 21st century and therefore the Electoral College is outdated on a several century basis. The Electoral College should be abolished because it is outdated and creates politicians that only care about the larger states. Even though America is a Republic the vast majority of people believe it is a Democracy, and that they elect the elected politicians as a people, but in truth elect people to elect politicians for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "To commence, the Electoral College has no need for presense because it is simply outdated. The Electoral College was made for people to elect people to elect a president, which in its intirety is completly unfair, also it was made when a smaller population was present and the ballot counters where unreliable without the use of electronic counters. Now, one can argue that age has nothing to do with the election process because the close ties rarely happen- the most recent one in 2000 and before that 1888- but a close tie is not the reason. Today the world lives in a modern era where we know how many people voted for a specific candidate but still we use the electoral colleg to see who wins what state. For example, Al Gore, the presidential candidate in 2000, \"won the popular vote but lost the presidency\"(9), now how is that fair? It is fair because of the Electoral College, where the popular vote isn't always the winner. Clearly, the Electoral College is outdated and should be abolished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the Electoral College creates politicians that care not about the country but the large states, which have the most votes. A presidential canditate may forget about small states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina and focus on larger ones, like California or Texas, that foster larger amounts of votes. For example, \"during the 2000 election seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina\"(13), but all the big states did. This is because politicians want to win and not focus on what needs to be done and only say what people want to hear. But once again there is always an argument; people can argue that the Electoral College wins by region, which explains why some states don't see the candidates, or that big sates allows for political balance. \"So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does\"(21).\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the Electoral College should be abolished because it is outdated and creates politicians that only care about the larger states. The US has outdated politics that have no need in todays society, why should the people depend on this outdated system? Also, the politicians only want to win the large states because of this system that does not always coincide with the popular vote. Overall, the Electoral College needs to be abolished.\n",

      "I know that you have many issues to think about and havee a lot of decisions to make, but I think it the subject of the Electoral College is a very improtant subject for you to ponder.  The Electoral College needs to be changed, we need to vote for the presidency with the popular vote.  I believe that the Electoral college needs to be taken away because it's not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College, the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate, and it is a very confusing process for people to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Electoral College should be changed because it is not the peoples president when voting with the Electoral College.  The people ar evoting for the president, but not really.  They are actually voting for a slate of electors, who then choose what canidate there electoral votes should go to.  The whole point of a democracy is to let the people of the country have a say in who is in charge, but with the Electoral College this is not happening. The people are saying who they want for president but if the slate of electors does not agree, then the votes go the other way.  This was expressed in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong\" by Bradford Plummer.  In the passage he says, \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for aslate of elctors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for insatnce, and wanted to vote for John Kerrry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Electoral College should be abolished because the legislature could approve people to be electors that are all against a certain candidate. The Legislature is technically responsible for picking electors and theycould very well pick electors that are all against a certain candidate. Everyone says the system is so strong but is it really? The fact that a group of people opposing one candidate could be the electors for that state and could totally changed the votes doesn't make the system look so strong. Plummer adressed this situation in his passage, he stated, \"Back in 1960, segregationista in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (so that the popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the Electoral college system needs to be taken away because it is very confusing. The whole system is just a jumble of different things. There are so many different steps and processes that tend to confuse the voters. When the voters get confused they often end up voting for the wrong candidate or making a mistake. If the voting system was just, the voters voted for who they pleased, then the votes were counted, then all the votes from states are added together, and then whoever had the most votes won, the whole thing would just be much easier.  I belive that when the situation is as impportant as voting for our president, it should be as easy and flawless as possible.  For example, when I was in seventh grade, I learned about the Electoral College in civics class. learing about the Electoral College was one of the hardest and most complicated thing I learned that year. How are people supossed to vote, if they have no idea how the system works?\n",

      "Controversial. This is the word that can describe the Electoral College in recent elections. The Electoral College is composed of 538 votes, a presidential candidate must acquire 270 to win the election. States with large populations get more electoral votes so say, Rhode Island. California gets 55 votes while the puny Rhode Island gets a whopping 3 votes. The Electoral College has been debated since the 2000 election, where Al Gore lost even though he got more popularity votes. Many folks believe the Electoral College should be abolished. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in the presidential elections, because it shows a clear winner, it ensures it is, \"Everyone's President\", educated voters count in the swing states and it avoids Run-Off Elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without the Electoral College, some elections may be hard to decide a true winner. No matter the situation, the Electoral College will determine a winner, if the popular vote and electoral vote become tied, (which is highly unlikely,) the vote will be taken to the senate. Each senator counts as one vote, so no longer do bi states matter. Also, the Electoral College ensures the presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal. It makes the votes count, the president chose is surely, \"Everyone's President,\" rather than a favorite in just northeastern states. Furthermore, swing states are tremendously important to the outcome of the election. States such as Florida, New York, Texas and California have dozens of votes combined, winning all four of those states pretty much means presidency. The swing states not only have more electoral votes because of population, but because of their voters. On average, there are more educated voters in the swing states, they actually stay up to date, watch the news and know the means of each candidate. The Electoral College also avoids the disaster of which no cadidate receives a majority of the votes cast. A good example of this is when Clinton had only 43% of the popular votes won, yet he got a whopping 370 electoral votes, which made him president. The pressure of having a run-off election is nearly vanished by the Electoral College. Although others say that the Electoral College should be abolished, because in that system, voters vote a slate of electors, not the president. Well tough , the Electoral College ensures a winner, and that is all that matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College should, for sure, be kept in the Presidential Election system. It consists of 538 total votes, and 270 votes have to go to a candidate to pick a winner. Although the votes may tie up, which is nearly impossible, the Electoral College ensures another method to decide the presidency. The Electoral College produces a sure winner, \"Everyone's President,\" is elected, educated voters are in the swing states and it avoids the disaster of a Run-Off Election.\n",

Sometimes a voter can get confused about the elector and vote for the wrong candidate. If there happens to be a tie in the votes, the election is moved to the House of Representatives. The tie could mean that the House's selection wouldn't meet the standards to make the people happy. The Electoral College system is really unfair to it's voters.

      "Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is more beneficial to the people than an Electoral College. The Electoral College is such a hassle and a process. It's outdated. And it's even irrational. It's not precise to what the people want. The popular vote directly represents who the people want. \"-over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" (Source 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College is outdated. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution. Back then that was relevant because there weren't as many people in the United States as there are now, which means there are more voters today. In Source 3 it says that the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. It's not even a democratic method in modern sense...\n",
      "\n",
      "The people trust the elector's to vote for their nominee. And that trust can even be broken, so they're not 100% reliable. \"-state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are....\" (Source 1). There's a chance that your vote might not even count. The Electoral College method may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. So even if that candidate got a lot of votes in one state the Electoral College can still eliminate that candidate regardless of the people's votes. \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" (Source 1). The winner-take-all system is unfair because candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, so they focus only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states. Which makes smaller states feel so irrelevant. They know their vote will have no effect because they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus the Electoral College is such an inconventient thing. It is a process that consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. And a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Why do that when people can just have an overall majority vote on the President? Voters can even expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Voters don't even vote for the president, their votes are for the slate of electors, who then elect the president. There could even be confusion that the voters vote for the wrong candidate because they are confused about the electors.\n",

      "Some people may not like the popular vote for the election of the president because they're afraid of a tie.

The House of Representatives hardly refelects the will of the people.\n",

The nominee that a person wants can still be voted for through a majority vote just through the states representative. Also in paragraph twelve Plumer worries about a tie vote in the electoral college and claims it is his biggest fear. A fear that has never been seen before in our country. There have been a few elctions where the difference was down to only 3-5 thousand but theses are still not ties.\n",

In the most recent election in 2012 President Obama had a very slight popular vote of 51.3 percent and his electoral vote was 61.7 percent placing him above all other candidates (Paragraph 18). Arguments against the Electoral College about unfair numbers because a smaller state like Wyoming gets 3 whole votes! While Florida only gets 29. The larger states still have more votes than small one just not numbers based in the thousands or millions.\n",

      "I am writing you to explain why the Electoral College system of choosing the president should be changed. The president should be chosen based on popular vote instead of the current system. The Electoral College system is unfair to certain states and somewhat confusing to others. I am certain that my views on this issue are not the only ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, the Electoral College system is unfair to states. Candidates for president don't spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning in. This is due to the Electoral College morphing the states into a winner-takes-all system as said by the Office of the Federal Regiser in \"What is the Electoral College?\". This means that the winning popular vote in each state wins the electoral vote for that state as well. The thing is, however the number of people voting compared to the number of electoral votes is unfair. I am aware that the number of electoral votes comes from the state's population, but imagine this; California, which has 55 electoral votes gets visited by this to-be-president and wins it over only by a small margin. Wyoming, which has 3 electoral votes, doesn't get a visit by this candidate because he thinks that 55 votes is more important than three and a large majority of this state votes against him. The candidate then loses three electoral votes, but wins 55. Sounds like everything works out well right? Wrong. The other half of the voters in California combined with the majority of voters in Wyoming could have taken the vote if it weren't for the Electoral College. With popular vote the candidates would have to actually care about the states like Wyoming instead of ingnoring them with Electoral College. With the popular vote system everyone has a say.\n",
      "\n",
      "To continue, the Electoral College should be replace because of the confusion it causes. Most people believe that when they vote they are voting for president. However, what they dont know is that they are actually voting for a slate of electors. This slate of electors then votes for who they want to be president, and this might not always be the choice you want. With the popular vote system there would be no confusion and no voting on people who you want to vote for you. Do we really know who we're voting for? Or are we just going on luck? The reason why so many americans do not vote is because they think that even though they vote, they do not have a say on who's gonna win. With the popular vote system we could directly vote on who we belive to be the right choice for president.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the Electoral College system should be replaced because with a popular vote system there would be fairness to all states and no confusion on who you're really voting on. With all of this said, I hope you consider my request and try to make a change.\n",

To be honest, that isnt fair that they get a vote. Who are they going to choose when it comes to voting? Someone trying to help us move forward or someone making our tax money got to the people who dont want to get off there lazy butt and do something. I do not know 100% of the facts on who can vote or not, but if a bum sitting on state road 70 all day begging for money just so he can go buy beer, seems unfair that he should even get a vote. In my opinion half of the population will end up voting for someone because, of what bad benefits he is offering and then we will be stuck with another bad president for another 4 years! Who knows more about congress then our congress? Lets be a honest here, do we really want all our tax money going to families with 8 kids and cant afford 2 or the bums on the side of the road begging for money or the trashy people hitting up crack ever time they get a little bit of money?

Yes, maybe our electors dont see certain benefits one canidate might be offering or doesnt understand as to why one might be better in your eyes.

Even with this article sort of informing me on this topic I still seem to have a misunderstanding (or no understanding) of what the Electoral College really is or what it does. Perhaps this is because of the lack of information I'm given about our government, or perhaps its because what the electoral college does is quite irrelevant to me and my fellow peers.\n",

      "From what I have gathered though, the electoral college is a group of people that citizens vote for and these people are then allowed to elect a president? I am sure there is a lot more to it but from that statement which is proven true by the article, I think the electoral college is dumb. Instead of electing biased people to choose a biased president, why can't we just let the citizens elect a president; someone who appeals to us and not a large group of people that get hated on all the time. By having the electoral college it's like the government is lying to us.\"Oh hey, we believe our citizens are the REAL people in charge of this country, but we aren't going to ever take off their training wheels.\" Our government hasn't actually said that. but it's the kind of vibe majority of Americans get.\n",

This could result in uneccessary recounts; delaying us of a president for even longer than it should.\n",

      "I am writing you concerning a topic that is very important to our country, and the citizens that preside in it. The electoral college is the current method of determining who will be elected as the president of the United states of America. As you know, it does so by allowing our citizens to vote for electors that then choose who they want as president for us. Citizens will most often vote for an elector that has sworn to vote for either the democratic or republican party's candidates for president. However, I don't quite agree with this method of election. Through my research on this subject, I have discovered that not only do these citizens not have the access to vote directly for who they want to run their country, but also that many electors go back on their word and vote for another party's candidate. I believe the system should be changed and the president should be elected through popular vote, and I'm not alone, according to a Gallup poll taken in 2000, over 60% of the population agrees with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the popular vote elects the president, every citizen will have their own choice on who they want as a president. In an electoral college, many people will merely have their votes casted aside becausetheir decisions or thoughts aren't the same as eveyone else in their state. Though some people say an electoral college is positive because it requires the candidateto have more than just regional appeal, but if people in that state like a specific candidate, even if they vote for an elector, the rest of their state may not like that candidate, and that person's vote will be cast away.\n",

      "House of Representatives. Since many people vote for a different party candidate than who they vote for, for the House of Representatives, they would not get their vote for president counted for anything, and the House may choose the president they don't want, without getting a say in any of it. Not to mention the 2000 election when Al\n",

      "\n",
      "Another reason for changing the method  to popular vote is the fact that all of the electors count the same. Since each state only counts for one electoral vote, the one elector from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, will count for the same as the 55 electors from, California, who represent 35 million voters. That simply isn't fair because it's the same as saying the opinions of only 500,000 voters in Wyoming are as influencial and important  as the entire 35 million voters' opinions from\n",

      "Why should the people living in smaller states have more influence than those with larger populations? Why shouldn't those 34.5 million people in California be able to make their own decision and choose their own vote for the President? The entire population of every single state in the United States of America, that has the legal right to do so, should be able to vote, and to have their vote actually counted for something instead of just having their decision made for them by someone they've never even met. With the popular vote deciding who will be president, everyone will matter just the same, which is how it should be since we are all created equal, and we all should have the equal power to decide how our country will be governed and who will govern it, we should all be counted; not just the small percentage that is at the top.

      "For years, the presidential election has been running with an Electoral College, one in which the public does not vote for their choice canidate directly, but instead for a slate of electors to have a final deciding vote. Although the system could have worked like a breeze when first originated-- a point to be reckoned with, since I do not see how the system ever correctly displayed the citizens of America-- the Electoral College method has proven itself to be un-deomcratic, unfair, and an unjustly irrational system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply stated, the Electoral College does not allow an accurate representation of voter's beliefs, taking their votes and twisting, manipulating them into a deciding vote from electors. The popular vote can be seen as an input/output machine, the people's own votes going in the contraption, and once inside, the input is stretched and exagerated to output a \"neater\" electoral vote out of 538. While some argue that the Electoral College vote is usually rather close to the popular vote, it just isn't the same as when the Constution loosely states America as a  'for the people, by the people' nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several times throughout history, the Electoral college has swayed the presidential election in a completely different route than what the outcome of the popular vote would have been. The perfect example, constantly brought up in arguments against the Electoral college, is the 2000 election with main canidates of Republican George Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Through the popular vote, it is clearly seen that a majority of voters chose Al Gore to be their president. Through the process of the electoral college and manipulation of votes, though, the Presidental canidate ended with George Bush winning the election with a 271 electoral votes versus a 266 pointed toward Gore, thus creating an entirely different viewpoint of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of an Electoral College is also what has swung possible voters out of voting rooms, the voting method's 'winner takes all' outlook overriding. With the set up of the Electoral college, popular voters decievingly decide for a slate of electors instead of a President. For example, if a majority of Florida electors voted for Bush, the entirety of Florida's 29 votes are down for Bush, even though not all electors really did vote that way. Those citizens in states who do not fit with what large majority of voters believe are discouraged in voting for their own canidate knowning that, no matter what, it's almost certain their state will end up giving its votes to the canidate they oppose. This can lead voters to not voting at all, creating an even less accurate election while the country pushes citizens to vote, frowning down on them if they do not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides major points, there are many smaller faults wiithin the Electoral college. In example, there is always the possibility of a slate voting for a canidate that differs from the one they have pratically promised to vote for. The fate of our country is put into the hands of the 538 members of the electoral college, opposed to the vastly greater full population of American citizens. Also, with the 538 Electoral College members being an even number, although rare, it is more likely for there to be a tie than if the popular vote was used in deciding the presidential canidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pro Electoral college argument is that the citzens in swing states-- states that are likely to go either way in an election instead of an almost certian outcome-- are more likely to pay attention to ad campaigns knowing that their state is most likely what will decide the winner of the election. Advocates say that they are, on average, most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, and that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide our nations outcome. This outlook is littered with flaws, first starting off with the fact that swing states get more media coverage than the rest of the nation. These voters are valued more than others and are given more information to have an informed vote. Besides the fact that it is proposterous to value the vote of one citizen over another, this isn't fair to members of other states who recieve virtually no coverage due to canidates feeling like the state's vote has been secured since day one. The nation as a whole should recieve all the facts together with equal coverage, so that each and every voter can become a thoughtful one, and not only those located in swing states.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the decision to abolish the Electoral College is a backed up one, the facts and details there to support, meanwhile advocates for the practically ancient method don't have many solid counters to prove their point.\n",

For example, the President of the United States is the offical who sends people to places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran to fight for our country. These people vote for the elector they want to send them over seas instead of the politicians in the electoral college system voting for who they want to be the president. There are only 538 electors to vote for the elector they desire and that is still more important than the millions of people that vote. \"We are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" is a part of the Declaration of Independence and the right of liberty involves our right as people to vote.\n",

      "\n",
      "To begin this argument, the Electoral College is a process established by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution. It compromises the election of the President by a vote in Congress ang election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Ther are 538 electors in the Electoral College, and only a majority of 270 votes are needed to win the election. Every candidate that is running for the President has there own group of electors, which are chosen by that candidate's political party.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many reasons that lead me to believe that the Electoral College should be abolished as soon as possible. This method even lost the presidency vote according to a Gallup poll in 2000. The main reason many others and I are against this method is this; citizen voters vote not for the actual president of the United States, but for a slate of electors, which actual do the real voting and electing of the president. Also, there are numerous different groups that even pick the electors in the first place. Overall, there are plenty of other reasons that this method is unjust and unreasonable, but it simply could not all fit in one letter. I do hope that you take this concern very seriously and do your best to make the change you desire.\n",

If the people are happy, and there is a comander in cheif, then its a win win situation. Every ones happy. The whole point. Why would anyone try to mess that up and change things causing chaos and unhappiness? I thought it was for the people not aginst the people.

The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people.

It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state.

People vote on the president because they like what they say that they are going to do for our country. For example (in line ten, the author says), under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" Basically, the people are not voting for the person they want, but for others to make the decison on who they think would be the better president .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the candidate for president is a favorited in the north, south, south west and so on, so that gives the candidate no incentive to campaign there. If there was not an Electoral College, then the candidate would have more of a chance to actually win people over instead of taking advantage of what reigon that they come from. For example, some people think that some candidates are anachronisms because their ideas are very outdated. With the Electoral College gone, the people who are \"zoned,\" for lack of a better term, for that specific candidate, can freely choose who they think would be a better choice for president.\n",

      "First off, I disagree with the Electoral College. I have a strong hope that we need to change to election by popular vote for president. The Electoral College is a process of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress (office of the federal Register 2). In source two it announces that the electoral college is an unfair way to votes. In my opinion I agree strongly with that statement because not everyone would get a fair oppurtunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, everyone has the right to voice their opinion on who they want to elect as president. With the Electoral College we wouldn't be able to voice our opinion as because as Source 2 explains that if you have Electoral College system the voters would vote for a slate of electors, but not for president. The state of electors would be the ones to elect the president. Therefore the people wouldnt get a voice to vote only the 29 people in Florida-shown on the map in source 3-not the whole state which makes it not an equal oppurtinuty to everyone who lives in that state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, when having Electoral College instead of population vote the picked voters could pick someone wrong. In source two it mentions that sometimes the senator could vote for the wrong person sometimes and not always can they control their vote. To add on to that the electoral college is the \"disaster factor\". The reason that it is the diaster factor is because the state legislatures are responsible for picking the electors and they could pick everyone thats agasinst a certain president and that the \"better\" president isn't picked and has a chance of our state being ruined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, my fellow friends of the State Senator I persuade you in choosing to change electing the president to popular vote instead of continuing on with the Electoral College method.

      "The Electoral College is not a place but a process that was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Each candidate running for president in a state has their own group of electors. A presidential election is held every four years so we can help choose our state's electors because when we vote for our candidate we actually are voting for our candidate's electors. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office.\n",
      "\n",
      "A single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. At a very basic level, electoral college is unfair to voters. Mainly becuase of the winner-take-all system in each state. It is proven that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational but I strongly disagree. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote but it rarely happens. I have five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree.\n",
      "\n",
      "One is Certainty of Outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. Second is Everyone's President. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count and that the new president will have no regard for their interests. Third is Swing States. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election. Fourth is Big States. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Fifth is Avoid Run-off Elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. An example is Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. They both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.\n",

      "Im writing this letter because I think that keeping the Electoral Collage is unfair to the citizens of the united staes and the candidates running for president. I think that keeping the Electoral Collage is unfair for many reasons. When i read this passage it gave me a claim, to get rid of the Electoral Collage, and it gave me the counter claim, to keep the Electoral Collage. Both the claim and counterclaim gave facts to show what they thought was right, but as i read this passage i thought that we shouldnt keep the Electoral Collage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main reason i think we should not keep the Electoral Collage is because its unfair. For example when citizens of the united states go to vote on election day every four years and they vote for who they would do the best job at making choices for our country. Their vote doesnt go to the candidates it goes to the Electoral Collage. I think that is unfair because its atcually them who get to pick the president of the united states not the citizens. That is also unfair for the candiates becuase they spend alot of time and money to get people to vote for them and when the people vote for them it doesnt really count because the Electoral Collage atcually picks who is and is not president.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also dont like the winner take all method of voting. When that happens its like the other peoples vote never counted. When the winner take all method happens voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign. They receive the most information and attention from the candidates. Even if they go all out when its time to start voting that doesnt mean that they should be able to decide the election. Everyone elses vote matters too.\n",

When you vote by the Electoral College, you are actually voting for your canidates electors. When you vote for the electors, it doesn't neccessarily mean they will vote for their canidate. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for, as stated in \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\"\n",

      "There is a single argument against the Electoral College is best known as the disaster factor. In 1960, segregationists who were in the Louisiana Legislature succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy. They did this so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. In almost the same way, \"faithless\" electors sometimes refuse to vote for their party's canidate. Instead they cast a deciding vote for whoever they want.\n",

      "The electors and segregationists in the Electoral College think they can do whatever they please. They make decisions that wouldn't be fair to the voters or the canidates. If the voter votes for a certain canidate but the elector votes for a different canidate, this could cause trouble and madness within the election. The Electoral College is not always fair. However, if we switch to the election of the popular votes, the election would be fair. The canidates would be chosen based on the number of votes they got from voters, not by who the electors want to vote for.\n",

      "People also worry about the prospect of a tie in the Electoral College. If this happens, the election would be handed over to the House of Representatives.

From this context, we can say that the House's selection can barely be expected to reflect the will of the people.\n",

If someone elects a certain canidate, but the elector votes for someone else, there really isn't a purpose for people to vote. If people don't vote, then our country won't have a president. The Electoral College can take this country downhill in several  ways. We should let the people decide who they want to run their country. That way, the voting will be more fair, easier, and not as many bad things could happen while the process of voting is going on.

That's another reason why I don't like them. Now look all they care about is themselves. I pretty sure most of the voters or the states don't know this but did you know when we the voters \"vote for the presidental canidate\" we're actually voting for a slate of electors? Electoral College lack democratic pedigree, also there practical reason, liberal and conservative reason. What I found out that is also not fair is to the citizens and state who vote, is that the winning candiate's share his share of popular vote with the Electoral College. First of all, we voted for the candiate not for the electoral. We don't know the electoral. Knowing this, we the citizens just might not vote anymore. The electoral is not sharing the presidential house, we choose one person to look up too. Not the greedy electoral.

In reading this letter I hope that I may persuade you to take this into consideration.\n",

Now the \"winner-takes-all\" basis caused for him to get all of the votes in the Electoral College, rather than not having the College, and dividing the respective votes to the respective canidate. This ensures that everyone who votes has a say in who will become the next President. Even some of the small states that feel that,\n",

      "The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers extablished as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of the people. This process involves selecting the electors, meeting with the electors, and counting the votes by congress. There are 538 electors total in the Electoral College. The presidential election happens every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. After the election the governor makes a \"Certificate of Ascertainment\" which has all the names of the candidates who ran for President. I believe we should keep the Electoral College because there is a certainty of outcome, it helps avoid run-off elections, and the electoral college helps balance out the smaller and bigger states with more people that vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcome of an Electoral College has a possibility of creating a dispute like in 2000, but this dispute is less likely to happen over a dispute over the popoular vote. This is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral College is greater than his share of the popular vote. Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote in comparison to the 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Mitt Romney. Trans-regional appeal is required in the Electoral College. If we got rid of the Electoral College then there would be a greater possibility of dispute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the Electoral College. This proves that the Electoral college avoids the problems of elections in which neither candidate receives a majority of the votes. When no candidate wins a majority the pressure complicates the presidential election process. The Electoral College minimized this pressure be invariably producing a clear winner every time. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, a large state gets more attention from candidates than a small sate in a campaign. As an example in 2012 Obama, got 29 electoral votes. In Wyoming the winner only had 2 electoral votes in the same marin as Obama. The Electoral College provides some kind of restoration for the weight in the political balance that large states lose by mal-apportionment of the Senate. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to read into and pay more attention to a campaign because they know they are going to decide the election. It is most likely that these people are going to the the most thoughtful voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, there are many reasons to keep the Electoral College. This process has made the winner of the election much clearer to decide. There are a lot of pros and cons to the Electoral College but the list of cons is way shorter than the list of all the pros to the Electoral College. We should keep the Electoral College because it creates a certainty of outcome, diminishes run-off elections, and creates a balance for the bigger states. The Electoral College has created a positive impact for our presidential election.\n",

      "There has been many contraversies over the electoral colledge. The contraversies have been wether America should keep the this form of electing presidents or abolish it from our humanity. The electoral colledge,for many years,has been a effective and conveinient way of an election. As was stated in source three,\"the electoral colledge is widely regarded as an anarchronism\". this means that this way of electing a president has been around for many years and was meant for this country. There are three reasons why it is  important to keep the method of an electoral colledge. For one,professional slate of electors can be trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Two,this method is more convienient,and lastly posses more acuracy.\n",

      "\n",
      "The second reason why keeping he electoral colledge is important is because it is far more convieneint for most people. Reular individual voting may take up someones day by haveing them wait hour at a time in lineat a polling station. this is very unconvient to the person,especially if there day is buisy. what the electoral colledge does is take that persons vote into the hands of someone else. this save time and money for the averadge person.\n",

      "The last reason why keeping the electoral colledge is important is because it pposses more accuracy than a regular vote.

      "I believe that keeping the Electoral College is a good idea but I also think that changing to the popular vote is also a great idea. I think we should stick with the Electoral College because you vote for your president, vice president, electors, and where the electors meet all at the same time. I don't think we should change it to the popular vote because then it wouldn't be fair on the people thats running for president or electors, we also wouldn't be able to vote for everything all at once so it would make things very difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sticking with the Electoral College would be the best fit in my opinon. I believe its best to stick with because everybody knows how to use it, its been aroud for many years and it has always worked perfectly fine and has been fair. Under the 23rd Amendement of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allowed to have three electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The eletoral college consists of 538 electors. The majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. If we switched to the popular vote, it would be nothing like how the Electoral College works. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice pressident, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

      "If we are to switch to the popular vote, people would b fighting and arguing constantly, there would be no piece. I dont believe anybody would be happy because thats not a fair way to choose how our President, Vice president and the Representatives should be picked. We pick a new president every four years so why don't we just keep it the way it been for a long time so we don't mess everybody up on their decisions. Another reaosn why I don't care to switch is because what if we run into a run-off election. If we run into one of those it would be hard to get out of it just because we wouldn't know what to do. Popular vote would also run us into \" swing votes. \" If we were to get stuck in a swing vote, everybody would have to re vote and then pray it dosen't happen again.\n",

Said system has to make sense. That is why electing by the popular vote should be our's.\n",

This makes absolutely no sense at all. The \"big states\" like California, Texas, and Florida have about thirty to fifty five electoral votes unlike most other states which have three to ten electoral votes. If the \"big states\" were to be won by a little by one  candidate, then he or she would have over one hundred votes toward his or her candidacy but only about sixty percent of the popularity for those states.

The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.

Picking the right electors is very important because they are basically picking our president. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how he electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. As stated in Source 3,The electoral college is widley regarded as an anchorism wich is a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by  declaring the candidate who recives the most popular votes the winner, but the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense.

For example as stated in source 3 # 1, Obama recived 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney...Because almost all states award electoral voted on a winne takes all basis, even a very slight plurality in a  stste creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is an even number, but its highly unlikley. Most times the 2 candidates running for president try to persuade the people and some people are fooled by ones promises and when that candidate gets elected  the people do not like the outcome wich messes up alot. The people should go by the important things that the cadidate say they try to fix, not by the promises that they are making to get it done for sure. Stated in Source 3, It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate whp has no hope of carrying their state democrats in texas, for example, or republicans in california. Knowing thier vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay atteneion to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular voters vote swings a national election, and in spite of  that, about one half the eligible American population did  vate in 2012's election.\n",

      "I think that we should keep the Electoral College vote system, because it is pretty much the same thing as election by popular vote. When you vote for your canidatate, you're voting for his electors. Then those electors vote for their presidential nominee. Not often do the electors betray their canidate, so odds are the popular vote will win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the Electoral College system avoids run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes, the Electoral college produces a clear winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason to keep the Electoral College vote is because if we had to vote by popular vote, it wouldn't be fair to some of the states. Canidates tend to visit the big states that have an impact on their election. That means that the states with a lower population don't get to see what the canidates have to offer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next reason is because some of the presidential canidates could be favored by some of the regions. For example, obama was elected as first African American president, and a lot of African Americans were excited, and voted for him. Some of the people didn't even care what he had to offer. The Electoral College reduces the chance of that happening because the regions vote doesn't have a big impact on the election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, we should keep this voting system because when the citizens vote for a presidential canidate, they vote for the electors. They choose electors that are going to vote for the party's nominee. So basically, if one of the canidates wins the popular vote, and the electors go to vote, the one with the more popular votes is going to win most likely. It rarley ever happens that the elector for one nominee votes for the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe we should keep Electoral College vote because it is much like election by popular vote. It is also more fair between big and small populations of states, and presidential canidates can not be favored by regions they come from. The Electoral College system is a good way to vote.\n",

      "I am writing to you to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. There are many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons I am going to point out ot you are, certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. There are also some reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College. For example voters vote for a slate of electors not the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all two reasons for keeping the Electoral College would be a certainty of outcome. Even though a dispute over an Electoral College vote is possible it is more likely to occur iver a popular vote. A reason for this is the winning candidate's share of Electoral College exceeds his share of popular vote. For example, in a article called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the 51.3 perecent Romney received. Because of the winner-take-all basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote  victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason would be you avoid run off elections. The Electoral College aviods the problem no one candidate receiving a majority of votes. For example, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the poplar votes, while winning a majoprity in the Electoral College.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two more reasons for keeping the Electoral College are swing states and big states. The winner-take-allmethod of awarding electoral votes induces the cnadidate to focus campaigning in toss-up states. These voters are more likley to pay close attention to the campaigning going on. They are also more likley to be more thoughtful voters. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by the mal-apportionm,ent of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "A reason for not keeping the Elecetoral college is that voters vote for a slate of electors not the president. These electors can be anyone not holding public office. The problem with is htat electors can vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the cnadidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are chosing the president they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conlcusion please take my reasons for keeping the Electoral College into consideration. Again those reasons are certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. Also the reason not to keep the Electoral College is voters don't vote for a president, but a slate of electors who do.\n",

      "Dear State Senator,\n",
      "\n",
      "My name is PROPER_NAME and i am an American Citizen. I already know about The Electoral College and its process. I know it has 538 electors and 270 of the electoral votes are needed to elect president. Along with that, I know that our founding fathers developed it in the constitution and their chosen by the candidate's political party. But i do not know why so much people bash The Electoral College when its a good thing. Based on my research, The Electoral College should stay and should be used everytime in an election for President.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Start off, most people think of The Electoral College as a non-democratic method of selecting a president based on Source 3: by Richard A. Posner. Its is a non-democratic method because its the electors who elect the president not the people. Based on Richard however, \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed\". Its possible to win the electoral vote but not the national popular vote. It happened in 2000, with Gore when he was running. But that was the first time since 1888.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some flaws of The Electoral College however. According to Source 2: written by Bradford Plumer, voters vote for electors who elect the President not the people. No one really knows the elctors and they cant be seen holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors and voters cannot always control whom their electors vote for. In addition, as Bradford said \"voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidates\". These disadvantages may want to make people disapprove of The Electoral College disregarding its advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are five really good reasons for keeping the Electoral College. Based on Source 3 the first is \"certainty of outcome\". This basically means if the winning candidate's share of the Electoral votes is high most likely his popular votes will be too. The next reason is that its everyone's president. Like Romney he only focused on benefiting the one region and the Electoral College had no favor in that and as a result he got no gains from them. The third reason is \"swing state\" like Richard calls it. The \"toss up states\" are the ones who really decide the election. Voters in those states pay more attention to the campaign since they are the ones who will decide the outcome. The last two reasons are the big states and avoiding run-off elections. A large state gets more attention from Presidential candidates in a campaign then a small state does. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candiates receives a majority of the votes cast.\n",
      "\n",
      "These five reasons make the electoral College what it is now. Most voters dont watch the Presidential campaign's and chose whoever. The Electoral College is fulled with educated people who actually take the time and watch and study the campaign's so their vote is the vote that makes a difference. Despite the Electoral College's lack of democratic pedigree its still should stay.\n",

      "\n",
      "================================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear state senator,\n",
      "\n",
      "My name is PROPER_NAME and i am here today to talk to you about wether or not you should keep the Electoral College. In my opinion i thibk that it would be easiewr to vote for the president by the number of popular votes that he recieves. In this letter i am going to explain to you why i think that its easier if we do this so please make sure you can read through this whole letter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing we need to know before starting to read this letter is that the Electoral college is basically a widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democractic mehtod of selecting a president that ought to be rules. Many people in the United States and in other places all over the world always face difficulties wether or not they like the Electoral College. If you acually think about it, in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for the slate of the electors who then vote for the president. So the people that are voting for these electors are not getting the direct vote. They are not getting sufficent amount of power to vote for the person that is going to rule their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A very important key that we asll have to know is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters. Candidates dont spend time on states that they know have no chance of winning. People cant put the fate of the presidency in the hands of a state that only have candidates because the candidates know that they might have a chance on winning!! And i do understand that we cant change this because some people dont like it but that is because people do not understand what the Electoral College is in the first place.\n",

      "I am writing to you today in regaurds to the Electoral College and whether or not we should continue to use it in our presidential election.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you know, the Electoral College was established by our founding fathers when they wrote the Constitutation. They established it as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and an election by popular vote of qualified citizens. I feel that we should get rid of the Electoral College and have a direct election by qualified United States citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason that I feel the United States should get rid of the Electoral College is because Congress can be easily swayed to vote a certain way in the election. One example of this would be because of lobbying. This process is where someone persuades a person to vote a certain way by bribing them with campaign funds or other monetary things. Where some may argue that the Congress should have a say in the election because they are chosen to be leaders in their states, I feel that because of some of the people that are allowed to be elected into Congress, the United States should leave it up to the rest of the population to elect the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason I feel this way is that through the electoral college, the population of a state votes on an elector who in turn elects the president. This is not fair because if you are a republican, you do not want the democratic president to win the popular vote. This means that if you are in a mostly democratic state, the elector for the state that you live in will most likely choose the democratic president that you voted against just because that is what some of the other people in your state wanted. This would be the same for a democrat living in a mostly republican state.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overall, this system has certainly an outcome. A state can create a lanslide electoral-vote which in return will give a victory to the canadite. Many candidates that win the election have had a popular vote. Even though this system can have canadites that tie, its very unlikley that this will happen becuase of the number of votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College requires the canadite to have a trans-regional appeal. Each region doesn't have enough votes to elect a president. That is a good aspect of this system because many people could favor a canidate in a reign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swing states are vital in an election. Voters in these states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign and know who to vote for.

There are two main reasons I bring this argument to you. First, we pay taxes, we work hard, we put food on our tables, and we put a roof over our future voter's heads. We have absolutely no control of anything in this world. Letting us choose who gets to boss us around is something that we earned as US citizens. If you're going to kill us, atleast let us choose the weapon. Second, letting the popular votes decide who's president is a great way for all of us to get to know each other a little better, we may disagree but alteast that way we share our opinions and feelings and that is the foundation to a very happy nation and world.\n",

      "\n",
      "After reading a few articles explaining the Electoral College system and reading arguements for and against it, I have decided the system is not worth keeping in place. The system does not take every voter into account, and our electors are not always reliable. Also, this system of voting can discourage citizens in non-swing states from voting, which may be it's greatest crime. The Electoral College is worn out and ready for retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College, although seemingly based on the people's votes, is really dependent on whoever the chosen electors want as president. It does not seem very fair for voters to spend months listening to drawn out debates, campaign commercials, and becoming educated on the candidates, just to have their vote essentially thrown away if they did not vote for the majority. No, they do not even get to see their vote in action. It is simply erased and given to a slate of electors who stand for the majority of the state, even if the majority is only 50.1%. To the new generation of voters who really want to make a difference in the government, the idea that unless we pick the 'right' candidate for our state, our votes really do not matter is absurd.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the electoral college system, even the majority voters in each state can not count on having reliable electors, according to Bradford Plumer, the author of an anti-Electoral College-article. Electors can be anyone who does not hold a public office, and these people can be swayed or unloyal to their own party as well (Plumer). These are the people our votes are really going towards, not the actual president as many uneducated could be led to believe. Although the trust of these people is rarely misplaced (Richard A. Posner, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our present method of choosing the President), there is always a possibility of the electors being swayed at the last minute, which is a bit of a scary thought. Imagine if segregationists in the Loisiana legislature had succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, one of or best presidents (Plumer).\n",
      "\n",
      "The final reason keeping the Electoral College system in place is a bad idea is that if you are a voter in a clearly defined state, that is, non-swing, you are more likley to decide not to vote at all. When candidates can clearly define states in which they know they will win, or have no hope of winning, they don't bother spending time there to educate voters. Voters in these states do not get all the information they might want in order to make an educated decision. This would lead to a biased, uneducated state in which voters don't care to vote because of a mindset that almost everyone in the state is of a certain political mindset and their vote is just another piece of paper that will not matter. These voters could also make rash decisions because they did not get to truly hear all of the campaignes. In swing states where there is not a clearly defined political opinion, voters will be bombarded with information, and although they may be educated and well versed in their opinions, the votes, no matter how close, will not really matter because of the nature of the Electoral College system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, the Electoral College system is not worth saving. Although some may argue it gives a certainity of outcome or restores the balance to heavily populated states (Posner), it does not give everyone's vote a fair chance. Nor does it guarantee the electors will be reliable. The Electoral College system even dissuades voters from excercising their Constitutional right to vote. Please take this into consideration, Mr. Senator, next time the Electoral College comes into question. Thank you for recieveing my most humble opinion.\n",

Honestley i would like to get rid of it because there are so many things wrong with it, even the best-liad defenses are wrong because our vote does not really count the popular vote could be voting for one of the president while the representative that represents us could choose to vote for the other president if he wanted. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a straight up election to the kind we have now. For example take in consideration what happened the year 2000 when Al Gore was going against George. W Bush, Al Gore had won the popular vote which means that everybody wanted Al Gore to be president. But George. W Bush won the whole election because of the Electoral College. Under the Electoral College system the voters are not voting for the president, but for a slate elctors,they decide who the president is. Which if you think about it its un american because this is a free country and a democracy and if we are not realy picking but just mearley helping decide who is president in a democracythen yeah my opinion is that its un american. What most worries the people is the prospect of the tie in the elctoral college which in that case the votes will be sent to the House of Representatives where they choose the president which if you think about its bad because lets say that the HR is being governed by Republicans and you the voter is a Democrat, which way do you think the HR is going to go, Republicans right, and how would that make you feel, not very pleassent i assume.

      "To begin with, Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president. Source 2 \"Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" states \" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the president.\" This quote shows that if you vote for a slate of Republicans or Democratic electorss pledged the president but those electors won the statewide election, those electors would have to go to Congress and the president would get the amount of electoral votes the people have made. It's a process having Electoral College systems therefore, it's much easier having popular votes for the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Source 3 \"Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" argues \"No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This quote is stating that not everyone has a saying on who they want their president to be. Like people in the South may have many elctoral votes but not other regions like Northeast etc. The entire community should be able vote, everyone should be able to vote. Electoral college systems shouldn't be able to reject no ones vote. Moreover, changing elections to popular votes is better because people have a chance to vote the president they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electoral College systems may be in favor in many ways like the winner takes all method, or each candidate running for president having their own electors. In whatever case it may be it's not fair to people having their own votes being rejected. Like i said in my previous paragraph everyone should have a saying on whom they want their president to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I'm in favor of chaging the elections by popular votes for the preisdent of the United States because everyone has the saying on the president they wish to have. Electoral Colleges do not vote for the president of the United states and not all regions pf the United States have an opportunity to vote.\n",

      "Im PROPER_NAME, writing you to ask if you could change the Electoral Collage, I'm sure I'm beside hundres asking for the same. Instead of voting for our slate of electors, we perfer to vote for the president himself. I have reasons, I will be glad to sure them with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, I believe the Electoral collage is not fair. The bigger states get alot more electoral vote, So it's obvious if the president wins all the bigger states their going to win. The way I see it, is that the little states don't matter, or they aren't as important, since they got little electoral votes. For example, If I was running for president my main goal would be to win all the bigger states first, like; California, Texas, Florida. With them three states I already have 122 electrol votes, Thats when I'll start focusing on getting my other 148 votes by winning the little states over.\n",
      "\n",
      "My other reason why myself, and hundres would rather vote for the president himself be, because of the mistakes of voting for the wrong canidate. Remember in 1960, Hawwii sent two slates of electors to Condress? What will happen?If you think about it anything and everything could go wrong!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly,Voting for the president himself would be easier, You along with others in your range would not have to worry about the electoral votes. Not only that it may also be less stressful, and crazier. Voters like my parents would not get confuse for voting the wrong elector, and giving her vote to the wrong canidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I honestly think not having the electroal votes would be best for our voters. I'm sure the candidates would enjoy us the voters making the mistake and voting for the wrong elector, since at the end of the day the Canidate is the one getting the vote, that wasn't meant for him. Instead of voting for our electors, why won't we vote straight to our president?\n",

      "Over the years, people have been disputing over the Electoral College. Some people want it abolished while others want it to stay. The Electoral College is not working and and it needs to be abolished. For many reasons, the Electoral College has not worked. It is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. According to source 2, :\"Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" The whole point of voting is so that you, along with many people, can decide who will be the next president! Voting for people to elect a president is just not right. It causes voters to not vote because they know that their vote really won't matter. Source 2 also states that candidates don't spend time in small states, \"focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.\" That is causing smaller states like Rhode Island and South Carolina to have less knowledge on the candidates. If I didn't know too much about a candidate, I wouldn't vote at all! Even though people in those states did vote, they might not have known a lot about the candidates and voted for the wrong person.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people running for office want to win. Source 3 says that someone could have a higher popular vote but lose the election. Is that fair to the candidate? Winning the popular vote but losing the election? No, it isn't. Winning the popular vote means that more people want you in office. If the majority of America wants a certain person to be the president of their country, that means that the winner of the election would be the majority vote. The Electoral College denys that basic right of Americans by not letting them choose their president. That alone is unfair to the candidates and to the voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you might be saying that the Electoral College has worked for a very long time and shouldn't be changed. Although the Electoral College has been working for a long time, that is the only thing that America has tried. If America used the popular vote, it could've changed elections. The Electoral College hasn't been working because it is causing more and more voters to stop voting and it is making it where only the majority vote doesn't matter. Citizens of America should have the right to chose the president by majority vote.\n",

      "\n",
      "I need to get something off my chest, we need to change the way we the people vote. An Electoral college isn't the right way to do it anymore. We need to change to the peoples popular vote. Because this is a country for the people, we aren't voting for the president, and because electoral vote just isnt't fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. President the first reason why we should change the popular vote is because this country is supposed to be for the people and in an electoral vote it's not. In the electoral vote its about the government and who they want as president and alot of people DO NOT like that. People of the United States of America should be able to vote and pick who they as a president of there country. It should be our right as Americans to be able to pick our own president not a bunch of old smart people in suits in Congress. I under stand that there is 538 as it says in the article What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register, but their is more than 300 million Americans.  So techinically we aren't even voting for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brings me to my next reason, we aren't even voting for the president. When there is an Electoral college we are voting for the slate of electors in congress that will vote for the president as it says in the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the systems are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer. So like I said before a bunch of old men and old women are they taking our votes away from us. For example, in 2000 Al Gore would've won the election but because the electoral vote beat him. He had the popular vote of the people but says the congress chose other wise he lost the election. According to the same article as it says above. Over 60% of people rather people's popular vote other the electoral vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but definetely not least, the electoral college just isn't fair at all. Maybe it's fair for the government befoore they can basically just pick the president that they want, but it's supposed to be a country for the people. It says it in the Constitution\n",
      "\n",
      "We The People not\n",
      "\n",
      "We The Government . Also the winner takes all system, the candidates don't pay attention to the smaller states they just look and the big states like California, Florida, or New York. So technically they are cheating the electoral college because they don't pay attention to all the elected slates of those small states. According to the article \" The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong\" by Braford Plumer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Conclusion, Mr. President if you care about what the people want you would abolish the Electoral college. Because this is a country for the people, we aren't even voting for the president, and because it's just not fair. It needs to be changed to the popular vote. I've been waiting to get that off my chest for a while.\n",

      "Dear senator of Florida, I personally feel that the electoral college is just plain unfair. I don't think it's necessary to even have it at all because what's the point if the votes aren't equal for all states? it's a very irrational process. It isn't right if a president wins the popular votes but doesn't win by electoral votes and it results in him/her not becoming president. If someone votes for a slate of electors and they end up not even voting for who they're \"supposed\" to be voting for then what's the purpose of electing them anyway? There is no purpose unless you want the other party to win which i highly doubt that. The electoral college affects the voting of states because if the majority of their state is republicans and they're democratic, there vote isn't really going to matter because majority wins. This process makes no sense to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of electoral votes that your state gets depends on your states population and not the size of it. I somewhat understand why they do this but at the same time it doesn't seem very fair. Yeah, i know life isn't fair but for something like this that has a possible way of being fair doesn't make sense not to be. Alaska with only 3 electoral votes should be able to have the same amount as california with 55 electoral votes. Since it isn't actually equal like that i feel that they should just choose who wins and becomes president by popular votes. This way would be a lot more fair because it wouldn't actually matter how many people lived in your state, it would just matter how many people voted for which canidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason electoral votes aren't right to me is because if a president wins the popular votes but not the electoral votes then it almost seems likes one of the types of votes is useful. It seems like this because then he/she may not win and become president even though they won the popular votes. The canidates shouldn't have to rely on 2 different types of votes because obviously one isn't fair. I feel that in a situation like this having popular votes is just a watse of time because it seems that the electoral votes are what matter the most. Not having an equal amount of electoral votes for each state really defeats the purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voting is done by the party's nominee that then elects a slate of electors to vote for the canidate but the problem is you can't always trust that they will actually vote for the canidate that they're supposed to be voting for. This isn't the only issue, sometimes the voters get confused and accidentally vote for the wrong canidate resulting in more votes for the opposing side. This is a another reason why i feel that the electoral college should be abolished for good.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the electoral college is just really not needed in our goverment. It is equal for all states which affects the vote. Also the canidate doesn't win based on only popular votes, they must win they majority of the electoral votes. Lastly but definetly not least, the voting by the slate of electors isn't certain and isn't always accurate. These are some of the main reasons why i feel that the electoral college should be left in the past as an anachronism.\n",

      "The Electoral College was created by our Founding Fathers. They put this in the Constitution to make electing the President of the United States fair and equal to all the citizens in the United States. The Electoral College should not be changed no matter what. To go against the Constitution would be to go against the nation, for we were built on the leadership of our Founding Fathers and the guidance of the Constitution. This Contitstution was created so that the people have more power than the government. So I strongly believe that the Electoral College should stay the same. It is the governmet that needs to change. There is nothing wrong with the Electoral College, it is just the ones that run it. So if there should be any change, it should be the government that should change, not the Electoral College!\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ectoral College is a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and by the popular vote of the citizens. When the voting starts the electors come to a meeting place and vote on who they want as President. After the meeting, there has to be a majority of two hundred seventy electoral votes for the election of the president. The electoral College is as I have said it before is fair and equal to all the citizens in the United States. To take this away now would be a catastraphe, because that would mean that all the other presidents in the past would not have even been our Presidents, the history behind them would be rubish and not even true. Some states may have a \"winner-take-all\" sort of thing but they are together and voting together as on state. Some of them may vote for the other one but the majority of them is for one person. Some of the states believe that it is not even worth it to have a \"winner-take-all\", because they think it is unfair. Then after the presidential election comes the \"Certificate of Ascertainment\" which is a list of all those who ran for President and there respective electors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college has been around ever since the Constitution was created. It may be unfair now, but if there would have been any changes to the Constitution it would have been done then instead of now. The Electoral College was probably a great idea when the the Constitution fisrt started out. Then the years have gone by and now we want change. Well I see that the Electoral College can be unfair but it is also fair in it's own right. Because of the fiasco in the year of two thousand about the abolishment of the Electoral College, it has left a scare in our nation about the government, because you guys are giving out the information on the candidates to late or not at all. That SUCKS, for most states because they may not even get one advertisment about the candidates any where or even a commercial on T.V. If the vote for the abolishment of the Electoral College does happen, then there is nothing that I can do about it, but you can still change your ways. You can make it fair and not irrational. Even send the \"Certificate of Ascertainment\" earlier than you have done before now. This is a nation of freedom and peace, how are you trying to keep the peace with other countries if you can not even keep the peace within your own?\n",
      "\n",
      "The government is the real problem, not the Electoral College. It may be unfair, because the majority of the people may have chosen one person while the electors may choose the other. Then when they add it together it is there vote that counts more than the peoples. If the government had only done the right thing and elected what the people wanted, then no one would have a problem with the Electoral College. It is stupid that the government is listening to what we have to say but not hearing it completly. The Constitution is a document of equality for the people. Not the government. If our nations democracy is a democracy then they should listen more to what the people have to say and not what the government has to say. If the government would do this then things would run more smoothly within our country and there would be less conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nation is a nation of freedom and peace. Not for a bunch of people who are power hungry. The Electoral College is fair and equal, it is the government that is not. If the government would only change for the better then there would be no problem. This nation is still young compared to all the other countries. They have gotten all there issues taken care of, but we have not. The reason is that some of the officials are power hungry and do things to take care of themselves and not others, but some are not and they want to make this country better. Those are the ones that should stay and not the power hungry ones. They make it fair. So I strongly belive that the Electoral College should stay the same, and that the government should be the one to change.\n",

      "I'm writing you this note to express my opinian wether or not to keep the Electoral College or to get rid of the Electoral College. My opinian has to go with no i'm not in favor of keeping the Electoral College due to the fact that it's unfair to a candidate that wins the popular vote but loss the election because the other candidate gained control of a state like texas with 34 electoral votes. Most people clear want this candidate better than the other but the candidate with the popular vote wouldn't win because the other candidnate would get states with more electoral votes. Another problem i want to adress is that sometimes the electors get confused on who to vote for i know if i had all that pressure on my i think i would get confused also from the pressure. The Electoral College can also turn off potential voters due to the fact that they hvae no hope of carrying their state. In other words people think they don't have a voice in the election because their vote really doesn't matter the vote that really matters is the Eletroral vote. Due to this reason less and less people vote these days. About i half of eligible voters voted in 2012's election as you can see there is a drop in voters. Most voters these days are people who want to expreess a political preference instead of people who think a single vote may decide who will win the election. Also Sentor im not the only one that wanted to gte rid of the Electoral College.

      "The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and a poorly representative system for our nation. Previous elections and facts show that the Electoral College may have worked in the past, but does not work in accuratley representing the millions of voters in our country any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2000 presidential campaign, the unfairness of the Electoral College was blatantly obvious. \"Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, and voters in twenty five of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaig ad,\" (Plumer). The vote was left almost entirely in the hands of a few \"swing voters\" in Ohio, which is not an accurate representation of the opinions of the American population. During this campaign in 2000, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, however, Bush received 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266,  so Bush was elected president (Plumer). It is obvious that the votes of the Electoral College do not accurately reflect the opinions of the people, and gives the citizens of our country poor representation in our government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arguments in favor of the Electoral College are weak at best. In the article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, the opening paragraph is practically an argument against the Electoral College. In the article, Posner states, \"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president... [t]he advocates of the position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic... it is the electors that choose the president, not the people.\" In this opening statement for an article about how great the Electoral College is, Posner proves quite the opposite. The people of our country deserve proper representation; each of their individual votes should be important and their opinions on who leads this country should be heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "As stated in this counterclaim, it is not the people who choose the president- it is the electors in the unjust Electoral College system.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a Gallup poll taken in 2000, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now (Plumer). It is clear the majority of the U.S.A. would prefer a different way of electing a president, whether that be a direct election, or another system that properly represents the nation's opinions. The list of possibilities of things going wrong in the Electortal College is large. Suppose there was a tie, which is entirely possible, since there is an even number, 538, of Electoral votes (Posner). If this happened, the election of the president would be put in the hands of the House of Representatives. In this system, each state casts only one vote, so the representative from Wyoming who is casting a vote for 500,000 voters would have as much say as the representative from California, whose single vote represents the opinion of 35 million voters . If this isn't an unethical process, I don't know what is.\n",

      "Mrs. Senator, as a citizen of the United States, and Democrat in the mainly Republican state of Florida, I want my voice to be heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the current Electoral Collge system, I am worried that it won't be. I shouldn't have to worry about \"faithless\" electors refusing to vote for my party's candidate, or the electors in my state not casting a vote that represents my opinions. In the free country of America, I want my vote to count and our government to make decisions based on what\n",

      "Recently I have begun to research the difference in effect on the people of Ameirca, between the Electoral College and the result of popular cote for President. I have found out that our founding fathers created the Electoral College in the Constitution, so that while the votes between Congress and the people may be different, ther could be a compromise. Our country; well our world, is evolving with the changes in generation. 2015 has come upon us, and with this year brings a whole new change in cutural diversity and tehcnology. So while I believe sticking to our coutry's Constitution is vital for some reasons, I also believe it is outdated in others.\n",

Every year, children grow older, new children are born, and people pass away from our fine Earth. Though this new generation we have built is going to, one day, become the generation that decides who leads our country and who doesn't. I believe that the Electoral College puts a restraint on the freedom our people, new and old, should possess. Our people have to vote for a party, a group of people that don't show either their faces or their true personalities, to trust well enough with their vote to go for the President they think is right for the Country. Although that is very rarely ever betrayed- as noted by my recent research -I do believe that it is against our certain rights as a United States citizen not to know who exactly we are putting our faith in. Also, even if we do put our full faith in these mysterious political parties, like we have for years and years, who's to say that our vote will even matter? Al Gore, in the year 2000, had more popular votes from the people than Bush, yet he received fewer electoral votes, which decided the winner of the election. Why have us put in our vote at all, if it means nothing to 538 politicians?\n",
      "\n",
      "Our country is made up of millions, upon millions of strong women, men, and children and they should be the deciding factor in the  elections. It's our country just as much as it is the men that make up the Electoral College. A requirement of 270 electoral votes must be made in favor for one presidential candidate over the, though why should such a small number mean more against the millions from the citizens of this great country, the same people that make up the great state of Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand the need for the Electoral College, when it comes to some decisions. Like avoiding a national catastrophe when it comes to the nuber of swing-votes. While I am a woman of passion, I do allow myself to see both sides of the story and I think while the Electoral College can do good, it can also do bad for this country. It is outdated, overused, and wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our founding fathers built the Constitution and this country we call home, and while that is a great thing...times are changing and the power of the House, and the Senate, should now be moved on to the people. Some states, like North Carolina and Rhode Island were even unable to know close to anything about the current eection between Gore and Bush in 200. I say every state deserves to know the news circling around their country and how it may affect them. The power should now be given to the people, allow them to decide and make decisions. Let the people know they are heard, they have the freedom that our founding fathers gave them in the Constitution. They can speak and let their minds roam for the good of this country.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the President.\" Voting gives people rights and freedom that not everybody has. If a voter wanted to vote for a President their vote should go towards the President, not the electors of the state, in all fairness. According to Plumer many people agree with the idea of changing the voting system by stating, \"...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" In Plumer's article he says, 'The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.\" By putting this statement in his article he is trying to say that the system we have now could all go up in flames if the right thing happened to get rid of the Electoral College, so Americans should watch out. The Electoral College is unfair due to the winner-take-all system. In this system candidates for the presidency don't go to smaller states because they know they won't win with those states. They stick to the big states with more electoral votes or with the \"swing\" states. That's what I call selfish.\n",

      "I understand that \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee..[however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" If the next President were to win the electoral vote but not the popular vote that is like saying that only the Electoral College voted and not the real voters, the people.\n",

The people deserve to make the decisions. Because the electoral college systems has so many holes and problems with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best arguments against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. One big example of the disaster factor is the 2000 year election. In this election Al Gore had more votes than George Bush, but still lost by 5 votes because of the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the democratic electors who oppose John F. Kennedy. If they succeeded and the popular vote went to Kennedy, it would not have actually gone to Kennedy. (\"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong\" Plumer)\n",
      "\n",
      "Second off, one of the most worrying things is if there is a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens the election vote would be given to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote for the president. The vice president vote is given to the senate. Each state only casts one vote which insures that 55 million voters and 500,000 have the same power. Given the size of those numbers, and that people in those states may vote one party for president and one party for congress, the House's decision could hardly reflect on the peoples choice. We have come pretty close to this happening too, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted differently. (\"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong\" Plumer)\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a few reasons that opposing opioninated people use to justify wanting to keep the Electoral College around. One of them is that the president has to appeal to multiple regions. A candidate can not just be a favor of the south and get elected, he has to campaign and be desirable to all the regions. This is good because a president that was popular in just one region would not be successful, because everyone else in the other regions would feel like they do not regard their interests. Unfortuanitly this is solved by popular vote, since it is by individual not by state. Other votes in other states balance them out.

Bush go wrong? If many citizens voted for John Kerry, why did George Bush win the election? Obviously, the Electoral College did not go through on what they were suppose to do. It feels like electors took advantage of their position and decided for a president that many of us did not want.

Even though most Americans aren't aware of that when they are electing for their choice of the president they comprimise with the most, they are really voting for electors to vote who the next president will be. It's not fair and it's not right.\n",

      "While reading an article about the electoral college(by Brad Plumer), I noticed that the electoral college system has numerous instances of it that make it wrong. While in place Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. chamber of commerce all agreed on abolishing the electoral college; And I compromise with this agreement because it is completely accurate and make sense as to why these political figures wanted to rid of the electoral college. This is called a \"Disaster Factor\" according to paragraph 11 in the article \"The Indefinsible Electoral College\" meaning that the state legislatures are literally responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. How wrong is this? Also given that so many voter vote for one party for president and another for congress, the House of Representatives' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "In source 3 of the article, it was very precise on as to why the electoral college should no take place. Our country has both republicans and democrats. Not all democrats have the same opinions as republicans, and not all republicans have the same thoughts as democrats. According to paragraph 15, the Electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. This is not fair to people who are democrats. The electoral system is obviously based off of mostly and strictly Republican beliefs. The voting process should be based on just republican bias, but also democrat bias. It's as if the democrats thoughts mean nothing. Paragraph 19 made a claim that Republican bias is baed strictly off of the region in which on lives, because majority of Reoublicans live in the southern states of the U.S. This makes other people(No party, Democrats, etc.) that are inhabited in othe regoins of the U.S. feel disenfranchised and feel as if their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, and that this person is not really their president.\n",

      "The article gave me an outlook of what the electoral college really is and how it works. The electoral college is not a fair process at all, and it is way the complicated for the people involved in some political job that is involved with the president, it is hard on the citizens that live in this country that have an idea of what president they want to vote for, and it is hard on us as a nation. The election process should be changed by the process of popular vote of the country's citizens. The  electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The electoral college needs to be abolished as soon as possible. Please take this into high consideration.\n",

But never the less i think that the Electoral College should stay where it is today because it's a fair system in which everybody has a reasonable vote. In ways the Electoral College does help in some ways by avoiding the difficulties and problems of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, \"Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).\" According to section (22). But what the real question is here Mr. Senator is what is the Electoral College? It's the process by which the compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. You probably knew that already though.\n",

Even if the Electoral Colege went away what would the government use as an effect to insinuate a new reaveling method on choosing the president? Also the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. But don't get me wrong the Electoral College has a lot of diffirences as well.\n",

On the other side of the arguement despite its lack of democratic,the electoral college has many reasons why we should keep it. the electoral college has all practical reasons,first thing first is it Certainty Of Outcome,second that Everyone's President,third the Swing States,fourth the Big States and Last Avoid Run-Off Elections. All of these reasons contribute into the Electoral College on why it should stay.\n",

What are we voting for? If we don't know who we are voting for then why vote. I understand having electors reduces the chance of having a president who can't carry our state,Eventhough the text says is takes away the chance I still think it reduces it I mean look at the Bush family they did a horible job and guess who elected them the electors. But still we have the right to vote for who we want but thats not the case, The case is that we vote for the the electors to represent our vote. I also dont agree with the winner take all vote because is I vote for someone i want me vote to go to that person not switch over to the other because he or she has the majority of the votes.\n",

      "For my next statement, I will be addressing the fact of unfairness the winner take all rule is not fair as a add on the bigger the state the more electoral votes it gets is not for every state should count as a equal amount of votes because its like the little states doesn't get any say in who gets to represent us. \"Do you have a older brother or sister?

      "Elections are up coming soon and before we all even know it, it's going to be election day. As we all know, there is this process called The Electoral College that was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers. To be honest, I think it is time for a change. If you really think about it, The Electoral College isn't really in favor of the people anymore. Here's what i think should happen, instead of on election day when we vote for just the President and just getting the senates that ran for the Presidental candidate, I think we should have two different votings: one for the President and one for the senates, here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, when election day comes around and we think we are voting for the president, we aren't, but instead voting for a big group of slate electors where they vote for the president. For example, if you lived in Washington and you wanted to vote for [John] Doe, for instance, you would be voting for a slate of about 35 electors pledged to that President. Then the slate of electors vote for the presdient, not the people, and I dont think everyone knows that. Most of the people that know about have said that The Electoral College is a \"diaster factor\" while the government says that \"the American people should consider themselves lucky\" WRONG!!!!!! The American people technically can't even vote for their own president becuase \"it's against the Constitution\" there needs to be a change. Like allowing some people who go in to vote to either: vote for a slate of electors who elect the President or just vote for the president themselves.

      "I'm not in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states because i've been informed that when we vote for our candidate, we are actually voting for our candidate's electors. the electoral college is a process, not a place. Our founding fathers had established this in the constitution as a comprise between election of the president. as said the electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president has his or her own group of electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The electorals are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but varys by the state laws on what their responsibility are. Presidental election are held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. we help choose our state electors when we vote for our president. most states have a \"winner takes all\" system that awards all electors the the winnig candidate. After the election, our state governor prepares a \" Certificate of Ascertainment\" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your sate with the electors too. so when we vote for our candidiate, then we are really votiong their electors. It should be that we just vote for our candidate and that be just that. the electors do the vote for their candidate, with our votes that we put for our candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Nixion, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all the one the that they agree on. And its that answer i had in the begining. To be against the electoral college. They want to abolish the electoral college. But they are not alone. In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of  the electoral college-won the popular vote, but lost the presidency. over 60 percent would perfer the direct election. Whats with the electoral college you may ask? Voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. I want to know who picks the electors in the first place? It really depends on the state who decides. One other thing about the electoral college is that they are unfair to voters. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. and voters in 25 of the largest media market didn't get to see not even a single campaign ad. So it is official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that is to be by declaring the candidiate who was givien the most popular votes the winner. There is said ti be five reasons for retaining the electoral college. 1. Certainty of Cutcome, 2. Everyone's President, 3. Swing States, 4. Big States, 5. Avoid Run-Off Elections. its an arguement that the electoral college method of selecting the president may be turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas, for example or Republicans in california. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.\n",

      "So as you can see the reason of what i had put down, the electoral college is one that im not in favor of because it being not fair. and the fact that we are voting for the elector, not the candidates who are running for president. wish that you can see it from my point of view.

      "\n",
      "I think that we should keep it like this because if we dont have enugh peolple to vote there may be a 100% that there will be a tie.

      "Dear state senator,\n",
      "\n",
      "I urge you to vote in favor of changing to election by popular vote to select the president of the United States. I urge this to pass for three particular reasons. First is because of the factor that electors could defy the will of the people or the peoples word, Second is because of the event of a it would already be handed over to the House of Representativese, and third is because of the winner takes all system.\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with the electors have and most likley will again defy the will of the people and the peoples word. For example, In The source The indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. By: Bradford Plumer, He states that back in 1960 segregationists in the Lousina legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who opposed president J.F.K. Likewise electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and vote for who ever they want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, is the most worrying, the prospect of a tie in the votes of the Electoral College. If this were to happen the election would be decided by the House of representatives where the state delegations would vote on the president. Since each state only has one vote a representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 wouldn't have as much say as the reps. from California who represent near 35 million people. In 1976 a tie would have occured if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted for the other side, only a few voters away from catastrophe.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Finally, The Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner takes all system. in each state canidates dont spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning. They focous most of their time in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign seventeen satates didn't see the canadates at all including Rhode Island and Sotheren California. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single ad. If anyone has a good argument to put their fate in presidency in the hands of a bunch of swing voters in Ohio, they are far away from the white house.\n",
      "\n",
      "And once again state senator I urge your vote towards changing to election by popular vote to select the president of the United States. Because First, is the factor that electors could defy the will of the people or the peoples word, Second is because of the event of a tie it would already be handed over to the House of Representatives, and third is because of the unfair winner takes all system.\n",

      "It is the peoples right to vote on who represents our country, but why vote if you cannot choose the the direct candidate you want? I demand the electoral college to be abolished, it is a violation of the peoples right to vote for who they want. It is enough nonsesne of voting for someone to vote for you. Popular vote is the fairest way to vote, in lines 24 though 31 of the text, it exclaims that state committee's and candidates pick the electors. So candidates choose the electors that the people vote for? How do we know the candidates or committee's aren't sabataushing their power and picking the people they opinionly want, as opposed to whomever? We don't!\n",
      "\n",
      "With the electoral college exsisting we are giving our power to other poeple that can vote for us. We are handing them free votes, so they can vote for who'm they'd like. That is not fair! They say that the most powerful person in the world is the people, but with the electoral college it has partially been robbed. In lines 26 through 27 of the text that supports the electoral college it states that \"it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\" That sentence proves to you that the people are incontrol of voting for their president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes people may say that without the electoral college favoritism may appear in certain states and places. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that! There may be more voters for one candidate in a certain place, but as long as the people voted for whom they want there is no injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "In lines 17 through 18 of the text that supports the electoral college it states \" that trust is rarely betrayed.\" RARELY? Meaning wrongful doing has happened between the lines of the electoral college, and are likely to happen again...Do not be blind to the electoral college's purpose. It is damaging the voting for our presidential election. Popular voting, where all equals and powers vote for the president they want.\n",

      "\n",
      "My first reason is on why we should keep the electoral college is because, there is a reason on why it is there in the first place. Im not that smart but im pretty sure the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they started the electoral college. it is there because it helps pick who is president and vice president. I mean sure we do help by voting but there job is to pick the best one, by compareing statistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "My  second reason for why we should keep the electoral college is because the people arent always right. Yes i said that the people arent always right, take for instance the George Bush we messed up big time by electing him, look what happened to the economy, but that is what we get by letting the peple pick. Im not saying that we dont know how to make a right descion but can we please let the professionals do what they do best.\n",
      "\n",
      "My third and final reason is that they do elect fairly  the bigger thye state you have the mor represenatives you recive, states like California,texas,wyoming,ect which means the bigger the state the more people sre going to live in that stae which would also mean that you would have more represenatives. i know that your saying how is that fair if just because you a bigger state you get more represenatives? well as i said in the last sentace it is because of population. because of population to even out the votes you would have to have more represenatives.\n",

      "I belive that in favoring of keeping the Electoral College.Therefore many people have different minds set if which they should have Electoral college. Here 's some background information stated in source 1 What Is The Electoral College \"The Electoral College is a process not a place'.\" The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise betwwen of the president by a vote in congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.'My reasons for this is because electoral college can be helpful,have people to rethink, and understandable.Many people thing of electoral college as torchure or even the wrong way to vote.Electoral college have different ways and similar ways from changing to the election by the popular for the president of United States.For example states in source one \"The Electoral College consists of the 538 electors\".\"A Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.\" Now as you can see in my essay there particular things I would like to talk about.Pertaining about how can electoral college can be helpful in a different ways of changing the president vote.For example what  might you think what would be helpful?Stated in source two people thinks \"Under the electoral college sytem voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president\". Now as you come to  mind this particular information is not only talking about coloubia is talking about the electoral collge also.According To Source Three \"And if an electoral tie seems unlikely,consider this:In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;In 1976,a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way\".People should rethink about their desicions before they pick and choose.According to source three \"The Electoral Collge requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.The  Electora is widely regarded as an anachronis, a non-democratic method of selecting a presiendt hat ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes.There are many diffent aspects of Electoral College.\n",

      "It has been suggested by others, even b y vario u s presidents, but I sha ll say it too: I belive that the Elector College sh ould be elim i na t ed from the process of voting for the president of the United States. The election should be based on popular vote by the citizens of the United States. The reasons  for this include the disaster factor and the prospect of a tie in the Electoral College can cause even more problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College consits of 538 electors and a majority of 270 votes are required for a president to be selected. When people vote for president they are actually voting for the state's electors who vote for the president in the Electoral College. Most states have the \"winner-take-all\" system where all the electoral votes go to the winning canidate of the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first arguement against the Electoral College is what is called the disaster factor. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors for the Electoral College. The disaster factor is when the unpopular canidate wins the election because of electors that aren't faithful to what they say and whom they say they will vote for. These unfaithful electors cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Also, a state could send in two slates of electors to Congress, making the election more unfair.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a tie in the electoral vote, then the election is thrown to the House of Representatives. This means that each state then only gets one vote. By way of this, one vote for Wyoming has the same weight in the election as one vote from California where the number of people is 50,000 people in Wyoming to the 35 million in California. The fact that so many of these people go unaccounted for reflects that this election may not be the will of the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize, the Electoral College needs to be eliminated for the process of electing the president because it is out-dated, there is a large disaster factor, and the fact that if there is a tie the vote become unfair--moreso than it already is.

      "\n",
      "To begin with, you've probably herd the term democracy since thats what our government is  right ? well that word comes from the latin words demo & kratia meaning people rule . Popular vote would be better than the electoral college because then peoples voices can truly be heard, no scams, no funny buisness, just old fashion voting. Popular vote is also an easier and much more simple system than the electoral college. with popular vote all you do is look at the polls and see who has more votes as apposed to counting each and every states electoral points until you get 273.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, if popular vote is put into action then it would inspire more people to vote, some citizens are very skeptical about the electoral collage but with popular vote the facts are in the polls.

      "Sir I would like to point out the fact that the Electoral College is a flawed, outdated system that serves no real purpose in today's world, however it is beautifully American. When the Electoral College was first established it was because we wre a country divided, not in idealogy but physically. We wre a great nation that didn't have electronic voting, the Electoral College was an institution of the people by the people. The folks that were chosen to pick our next President could have been your neighbour or your doctor or even you, yourself. In today's modern, connected world it may seen unnecessay but this established intstutitution of voters voting for voters is still needed. If we switched directly to  a modern vote the wait times on a new POTUS would be unbelievable. Losers could claim fraud because of the electronic voting. Every election would now seem like the fiasco in 2000. It would make 2004 seem like a fair election and 1888 wouldn't even be remembered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do believe that the \"winner takes all\" system could be tweaked a little to catch up to modern time and that states like Maine and Nebraska are on to something. Minorities in bigger states such as Republicans in California and Democrats in Texas need a voice. An uneven number of votes is also needed to end the possibility of a tie. There needs to be more clear cut rules on what to do.\n",

This electoral process consists of regulating the way in which our nation will decide who will be the next president. Consisting of 538 electors, a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This system allows the most experienced people to choose the future of the nation, and changing it to anything else would slowly cause the whole federal system to collapse. The electoral college method may not seem democratic in a modern sense, because it's actually very unique. This method turn off potential voters for a reason; The candidate that must be chosen is the most prepared one. There is so many factors related to the immense amout of security the college electoral process brings to our people that changing this precise system would be like deciding to turn off the country. Choosing an unprepared president will potentially cause the economy to break, civil wars involving every state, protests, and our nation's reputation to die. It was also revealed this year that in the states in which education is one of the main investments, nearly 90% of the people were in favor of the keeping the system the way it is.

      "The Electoral College is filled with electors that people from different states voted for. They are the people who vote and elect the president and vice president. Their votes are more imprtant than everyone elses because they are higher people than everyone else. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. They need 270 electoral votes on a president before the elect one. Every candidate the is running for president had their own group of electors, so of course they gonna vote for them and thats not fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that each candidate shouldnt have their own electors because it wouldnt be fair if one candidate had 20 electors and another candidate has like 10. Bascially the candidate with the most electors has a better chance of winning the election. Each state has a group of electors that vote for their state and thats not right. It shouldnt be up to the electors to vote for their state, everyone should just be able to vote for who they want to be president and see what happens from there. Not everything is up to the electors.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shouldnt keep the Electoral College because its not fair that their votes matter more than the communitys. Everyone in the world is able to vote for who they want for president. Then finally when a president is elected most people are angry because the Electoral College picked who they wanted and didnt pay much attention to the communitys vote. Instead of the Electoral College voteing and choosing the president it should be up to the community. After everyone has voted, we should just add up who got the most votes and whoever did should be elected as president. It shouldnt be up to the Electoral College. Just because they are higher then everyone else, they shouldnt just be able to choose who they want for president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also not everyone is able to vote, and thats not fair. The Electoral College adds there votes to everyone elses and then elects the president they want. But what about the people who didnt vote? Everyone should have a chance to vote. It wouldnt be fair that the Electoral College elected a president when theres people out there who didnt even have the chance to vote. In source 2 paragraph 14 , it says,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"its offical: the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational\"\n",
      "\n",
      ". That is true, they arent fair because they make it so that their votes are more important than everyone elses. Most people dont even vote for president, they vote for electors in the Electoral College so they can vote for president. I bet that everytime the Electoral College voted for a president people from different states yelled and screamed at them.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the best thing is to pay attention to who everyone in the United States is voting for instead of the Electoral College. If we keep voting like this sooner or later everyone is going to get fed up with it and do something about it themselves.\n",

      "Ever since our founding fathers established in the constitution that the president and vice president votes were determined by electoral college, the founding fathers made a good decision. Electoral College is a process where electors gather for a meeting and count the electoral votes to determine the new president and vice president. The United States should keep Electoral College to determine the president and vice president rather than a popular vote because Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than popular votes because electoral college avoids run-off elections. If somebody was running for either president or vice president and they recieved thirty percent in popular votes, nobody would know if the person with thirty percent popular vote would win the election. Electoral College prevents confusion by producing a clear winner. For example, in source 3, the text reads \"Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992 had only forty-three percent of popular votes but both had three-hundred and plus electoral votes which made them win the election\". The president and vice president make sure our country is running well and that we as a country have no problems. If we were to determine our president and vice president by a popular vote, whoever could kiss up more to the voters would win the election even if the person running doesn't meet up to the qualifacations of the person they are running against. Avoiding a run-off election is very important because no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Also, if a popular vote was how the president and vice president were decided, not as much people would pay attention to voting because voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign of the people running for president and vice president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than a popular vote because Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote. In 2008 when Barack Obama won his election to become the 44th president of the United States, he didn't win by being the popular canadite, Obama won by his passion to make this country better than it already is. For example, in source 1, the text reads \"The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president\". That way of electing the president is more fair than a popular vote because you need 270 electors to say yes to make you president rather than people making you president by if your popular or not. Electoral College is what keeps our elections fair. There is no other way to elect somebody president becuase no other method will be this successful than Electoral College. After all, Electoral College has been the way to elect the president since the constitution was created. Popular Voting is a bad method if were used to determine the president and vice president because somebody who is running for president can manipulate people to think he or she is a good canidate for president when they really aren't.\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, Electoral College should continue to decide the president rather than popular votes becuase Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than popular votes. Why should we change the way we elect president if this method has been working for over 200 years? Electoral College should continue to decide the presidency for years to come because it works so well. That's why Electoral College will stay as the way to elect the president.\n",

      "Dear Senator Nelson,\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, many people have called for the change of the presidential election process. Specifically, the Electoral College. Many condider it a pointless, unfair, and archaic system that denies the people the liberty of choosing their president. However, I believe the Electoral College is a necessity in modern America. Although it is as old as the country itself, it is still relevant and usefull today.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College ensures the outcome of an election. Without the Electoral College, the election may possibly need multiple re-runs as a result of a tie in the popular vote. According to \"Does the Electoral College work?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president\". With that few of electors, it reduces the chances of a tie occuring. Although it can happen however, it's not probable. For example, if two canidates ever had a tie among the popular vote, it could be resolved within the college because of the way the slates of electors are divied up among the states. Some critics of the college say that this systems takes the control out of the peoples hands and denies them the right of choice. However, you have to remember that the people elect a slate of electors to vote for their canidate. That means that even though the College ultimately decides the president, the people still have someone to represent their canidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Electoral College is also a necessity because it forces the canidates to face issues the people care about and to appeal to the masses. According to \"In Defense of the Electoral College: 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president\" by Richard A. Posner, \"The Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluralarity in those states\". This means that in order to win the popular vote and get a chance to win within the Electoral College, a canidate must appeal to the country, not just a particular set of voters who may have different views on politics than the majority of voters. Some people say that a canidate may try to appeal to a set of voters but in the end just use them in order to win the presidency. To that I say this. As a canidate, your ultimate goal is to serve two full terms as the president of the world's leading superpower right? Why would a canidate want to lie and jeprodize their chances at doing what they feel is right for the country?\n",
      "\n",
      "In Conclusion, the Electoral college must not be done away with. It is a necessary tool to maintain fairness among the canidates and the election process. We have checks and balances among the government so one branch of government may never gain more power over the others so why not supervise the most important process in government? If you take anything at all away from this letter, please let it be this. The Electoral College is a staple in American politics. Without it, we would be denying our country the right to a fair election.\n",

      "Being a man of your calibar and stature you may already know about the Electoral College. This is the process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. I'm writing this letter to you today beacuse I believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of electoral college has been around for years. I mean think about it our founding fathers created it. Which means its four score and a thousand years too old and irrelevant to todays economy. Sure it helped thousands of years ago but this the dawn of a new era. Why would it still be effective today? Its outdated! You and I both have heard the expression of \"If it aint broke dont fix it.\" Well this the check engine light going off in your car, which means its time for a change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, its unfair to the citizens of our nation. For instance, because each state casts only one vote, the single representatives from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Sure it helps with Wyoming and the proportionality of their representatives. But,its completely unfair to all those citizens of California who pay their taxes, work hard for their money to better their state. Take the time out in their day to vote. You're telling me that their vote doesn't have a valid say in the choosing of the President?, non sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the electoral college is completely irrational. Its was created to prevent any regional favorite in voting and for a long time it has been successful in doing so. It totally contradicted itself in 2000, when the Gore had more popluar votes than Bush but yet fewer electoral votes. Bush went on to win the election and manage to destroy the country along the way as well. They thought that it would never happen? I mean the amount of electoral votes is an even number(538). Its unlikely I mean but its not impossible.\n",

      "I can't help but notice the controversy regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. While most argue that the Electoral College is a violation of freedom, I strongly believe that the Electoral College premotes equality for the candidates and the people.\n",
      "\n",
      "By using the Electoral College system, we create an equal playing field for the candidates. For example, The Electoral College system serves as \"checks-and-balances.\" In the words of the Office of the Federal Register in \"What Is the Electoral College?\": \"The founding fathers established [The Electoral College] as a compromise between Congress and election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens,\" (Office of the Federal Register 1). This system of voting balances the voice of the people with the voice of Congress. Opposers might say that our votes don't even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn't directly determine our nation's President. This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. The Office of the Federal Register writes that \"most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate,\" (Office of the Federal Register 7). This means that the popular vote does determine - for most states anyway - whether or not the candidate recieves all of the electoral votes for that particular state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only does the Electoral College ensure equality for the candidates, but for the people as well. For example, in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer whines about how, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,\" going on to say that, \"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states,\" (Plumer 13). However, Richard A. Posner makes a fair point: \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president...[If a candidate with only regional appeal becomes President] the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president,\" (Posner 19). Moreover, Posner also writes that \"Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the competing candidates - knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful votes should be the ones to decide the election,\" (Posner 20).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedom of speech. I do hope you take my thoughts under consideration. The Electoral College may be called \"outdated.\" But as the saying goes, \"If it 'aint broke, don't fix it.\"\n",

      "The Electoral College has been around for quite some time. It has aided us in the election of the president for years. Is it truly fair though? Are the right votes being expressed? Whilst the Electoral College has a history for determining and appointing the president, I believe that it is not quite fair as it doesn't use the direct votes of the people, the slate of electors have the ability to defy the will of the people, and the voting system just isn't fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, in this system of voting, the actual votes of the people aren't used. The people vote for a slate of electors who in turn vote for the president. These electors can be appointed by state conventions, the state party's central committee, or even the presidential canidates themselves. These electors may be chosen and then paid to vote for a certain canidate and therefore swinging their decision to an obvious bias. This is quite troubling as when it comes down to the actual counted vote, it really isn't the will of the people as a whole, it's the will of those few electors who have the ability to vote for the other canidate rather than the one they are chosen to vote for.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, the electors that are chosen may have been chosen for a certain canidate, but are payed off to vote for the other. Though this is unlawful, it is a possibility. The people vote for these people rather than the president themselves, so the decision rests on this slate of electors. Should they change their mind on who they want to vote, or should they be paid in someway, they could defy the will of the greater people who have voted for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having established that it is not the actual vote of the people, but a slate of electors electing the president, the number of actual votes do not go towards the president. Though a canidate may have the highest number of popular votes, if they do not have the highest number of electorial votes, they are not going to win. I believe this isn't right as the votes for the president should come directly from the poeple. If a canidate has the highest amount of popular votes, I believe that canidate is the one that should be appointed president because it is the greater people that favour them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In closing, I believe that the of the Ellectoral College should be abolished as it isn't the vote of the poeple being used, the slate of electors always has the ability to defy the greater will of the people, and the over all system just isn't fair. There are many kinks to this process that I believe direct voting will take care of. I acknowledge that such a transition would be quite the lengthy process, but I would like to see the change happen. Wouldn't you like to see the actual voice of the people expressed?\n",

      "\n",
      "There is one particular issue that has been boggling my brain recently. It is none other than the electoral college system. Irrational, unfair , and outdated is exactly what the electoral college system is. Isn't the virtues of American's built on foundations such as rationality, equality/fairness, and mobility? The head of the United States government isn't even elected to the standards that we, the American people, hold ourselves to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Senator, I agree with the clause \"majority rules\" to an extent, with \"winner takes all\" being on the whole other side of the ball park. If Americans had a straight voting system, meaning no electoral college, where simply stated, whichever candidate recieves the most votes wins, the process in which we elect our government head would hold truer to our values. With our current system, hundreds of thousands of Americans votes don't matter. This mass of people is citizens of eligibility to vote. Where are there rights? What does this say about our system? The \"winner takes all theory\" ignores voters. If a state leans 51% democrat, then the entire state is accounted for the democratic party. What about those 49% of republicans. Where does their vote go? - down the toliet along with the credibility and accuracy of the electoral college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if this predicament occurs in near half of our 50 states, a candidate who did not recieve the popular vote will reign triumphant over a candidate who a majority of the American people elected to be their new president. According to, \"The Indefensible College\", by Bradford Plummer, Americans lose out on more than just an acountable vote. Candidates don't even spend time in the states they are certain of having no chance in winning. Logically, candidates only spend their time in the \"swing states\" where they could possibly steal al of that states eleectoral college votes (lines 13-20). Shockingly 17 states didn't see a single candidate during the 2000 election (lines 20-21). We sure did suceed and ignoring hundreds of thousands Americans there.\n",

      "This neglect isn't the fault of the candidates though. Where shall i place the blame, Mr. Senator? There is no childish, frivilolus blame to be placed. Simply stated, the fault lies in our electoral college system. The candidates are just playing the game of the electoral college. The counterclaim for my argument may suggest that the certainty of outcome and the expulsion of run-off elections is enough to substantiate the electoral college. Are you saying that America doesn't have the time to recount votes to ensure the prosperity of the American people. Is that the messege you want to project? It sure isn't coming off well.\n",

      "The certainty of outcome is ludicrous as well. Source 3, \"In Defense to the Electoral College\", even admits that the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president (lines 15-17). Liars, we are liars then. Americans project an image of America to the world that we are a peacful democracy. However, if the way that we select our leaders isn't even democratic, why are we portraying this false mirage. The electoral college is an anachronism (lines 15- 16). We are a stage four country on the demographic treansitions model. Therefore, our aspirations should be looking forward and not rooted in the past.\n",

May I direct you to the preamble to our constitution? Isn't that the sole foundatio of our government? The electoral college system is a mock of the American people and an outdated idea that does not fit in with our current state as a whole. A win by the popular vote is much more commendable by a landslide victory on false pretences.\n",

      "Honestly sir/ma'm i think that it would be way better if we just changed our election on popular vote instead of having it as an electoral college. Me personally i think that the whole electoral college thing is kinda dumb mainly because what it stated. That paragraph mainly talked about how the electoral college consist of 538 electors, and 270 votes are required to elect the president. Honestly it probably wouldnt be as difficult if you just voted on most popular. For example the \"disaster factor\" was named the single best argument and that was about how americans should be lucky that that 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. Im not gunna lie there was a little bit of some negatives effect. For example if we would of did popular votes when president John F. Kennedy ran, he would of lost the election and had not became our prsident. Lucily we didnt change the system then, am i right. Although it has some negatives there is way more positive effects. Im not saying using the electoral college way is bad because they do have some good cause; for example there is atleast 5 good reasons. Hopefully you know all 5 but ill tel you my top 3 reasons on how the electoral college has some good effects. On good positive effect is how hey say it, \"Everyone's President\". What they mean by that is like how no region would have enough votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorie like Romeny was in the south had no incentive to campian heavily in those states. another good reason was named \"Big States\". They meant like every big state like Texas lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. One last reason was known as \"Swing States\". By that they meant like what had happened with Nixon and Clinton. They both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a major in the electoral college. But like i said there is still some negatives about it and my opinion like i said was to vote on popularity. So Mr/Mrs State Senator you got my opion, you should use it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now there are going to be a lot of people that disgree with me, but let me tell you my reasons. My first reason is the electoral college is not fair to the small states. Because small states only get a small number of electoral votes canidates do not visit the small states that often. So how is that fair?\n",

      "We all know that the presidental election process is very important to our nation.  Many believe that using Electoral College is not a democratic pedigree, and that using the popular vote method is better.  I believe that we you keep the Electoral College in electing our nation's president.  There's a less likely chance that there will be a dispute, and we'll avoid run-off elections, with Electoral College.  During a presidental election, it is possible to have a dispute over who should be our next president.  The Electoral College helps reduce that issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the Electoral College voting method is better than voting by popular vote.  With Electoral College, we're less likely to have a dispute.  A lot think that a dispute over an Electoral College could not happen.  According to \"In defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", a dispute is possible.  A dispute happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College rarely exceeds his share of the popular vote.  The third source gave an example of the Obama and Romney election.  Obama recieved 61.7 percent and Romney recieved 51.3 percent of the electoral vote.  Making a certain outcome of the election, and not resulting in a dispute.  Also, with Electoral College we avoid a run-off election.\n",
      "\n",
      "To continue, the electoral college avoids a ruin-off election.  It avoids the problem where no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  The third source stated above, gave an example using the Nixon and Clinton election.  They both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.  When no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, it complicates the presidental election.  The Electoral College reduces any complication involving that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Electoral College is the method in which we select our president, it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.  Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California, have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign, knowing their vote would have no effect.  But, no voter's vote swings a national election.  Which means about one-half of the Americans eligible to vote, did not.  People that vote are people who want to express their political preference, rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.  The Electoral College method is the choice to pick.\n",

      "I believe that the Electoral College is the method we should continue using when electing our nation's president.

      "What Is the Electoral College?\n",
      "\n",
      "by the Office of the Federal Register, it was first established \"in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" What I understood from that text is that it was made to keep equality and fairness between the government and the people. If that is so, why is it that the people have no say in it? I believe that the election should be based on the popular vote because the people should get what the people want.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Constitution says \"We the people, by the people, for the people,\" yet the people have limited power. I understand that in order to form a more perfect union of our nations, their must be laws and rules and people who govern, as well as enforce, these laws and rules. All I'm asking for is a bit more freedom and power as a citizen of these United States of America.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not the only one who thinks this way. \"...according to a Gallup poll in 2000...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" Their has been several cases in which the candidate has \"won the popular vote but lost the presidency\" (Plumer). For instance, the election in 2000 with Al Gore, where his opponent, George W. Bush, received 271 electoral votes and he received 266, eventhough Gore won the popular vote. Instead of voting for a group of people who vote for us, what's the harm in letting the people choose our nation's leader?\n",

      "\n",
      "What's wrong with the electoral college in which he questions \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for?\", to which he replies, \"Not always.\" If \"we the people\" are supposed to be the one's with the freedom, then we should have the freedom to at least choose who we're going to have as our President.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.\" (Plumer). Take Mitt Romney, for example. He ran for president in 2012, and, knowing that campaigning down South, where he would already be receiving the votes, would not gain him any electoral votes, he didn't campain there at all. This is why they focus on the \"swing\" or \"toss-up\" states, and make the other states feel left out, like \"the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.\" (Posner)\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent the states to feel left out and to prevent an injustice such as this one, we should end the anachronism that is the Electoral College. \"...The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.\" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have all agreed on it at one point in time: \"Abolish the Electoral College!\" (Plumer).\n",

      "I am here to tell you about the electoral collage, and not why we should keep the horrible thing, but how we can replace it with something better. The electoral collage has been in use for a very long time, since the Constitution was finalized, but it should end now. The Electoral Collage is a confusing system that can easily be manipulated and changed to benifit one political party. As shown in many past elections, it has just become another reason people do not want to vote. Popular vote is easy and simple and it should be used in future elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all confusion is a huge factor when talking about  the Electoral collage. We as voters do not want all these processes. We do not want hoops that we want to jump through. We are simple people who want a simple process. In the electoral collage,  there are 538 electors, with a majority of 270 needed to be voted in as president. Each state gets entitled to two for your senators, and one for each member of the House of Representatives. This so far is making my head spin. This could be so much simpler if we just used the poular voting system. In this system, the people can directly vote for thier president without any huge hassel. This makes it easier and more fair for the voters. Speaking of fair, lets talk about how Unfair the Electoral Collage is.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Electoral Collage, there is no partial winning. It is a winner take all system, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This makes it very unfair to votes. Swing states add on to this idea. Swing states are very large states that have a higher representation in the Electoral collage. These are also the main targets of presidential cannidates. By getting these swing states, cannidates can gain a lot of votes in one state. This leaves other states, such as Ohio and Montana with little to no interaction from the presidential cannidates. This is not fair. We need the popular vote system. We need to be able to equally represent everyone without any shady practices. And that is the last topic, the electors really control the final outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final sin of the electoral collage is just too big to look over. The electoral collage can change wether a person is voted in or not because of the electors. They choose who they represtent. If you can not see where this is going let me explain. A set of people who want a specific president can just represent him. This could go so far as to leave a state with only representatives of one cannidate. This could never happen in popular vote because we don't have electors, we have people. We have real American people who want to vote for who they want to vote for. Nothing more, nothing less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the Electoral Collage seems like th root of all evil, there are a few upsides. First, there is less likely to have a dispute than a popular vote. A dispute is not impossible, it is just less likely. Second, big states are weighted how they should be. They are larger states that comprise most of the population and the country. They should be represented more than smaller states. Finally, since it is a winner takes all, there are no Run-Off elections. This keeps the process shorter, but not as short as it would be in the popular vote system.\n",
      "\n",
      "So to conclude, popular vote should be used in upcomming elections. The electoral collage is a confusing system that can easily be manipulated to help or hurt a specific cannidate. Although the electoral collage properly represent smaller states and avoids Run-Off elections, it does not represent smaller states and can easly shift the election from one side to another. Popular vote keeps the process short and makes it fair. It represents everyone fairly. I do not want you to agree with me, I want you to look and the cold hard facts. Popular vote should be used in the Election from now on.\n",

      "I would like to address a concern that seems to have the American people questioning their voting decisions. As a responible citizen of the United States of America, upholding your right to vote is an important duty. However, in the case of nationally voting to decide our vital political figures, such as the President and Vice-President, the ballot of the Electoral College is not giving the voters of America a fair result when it comes to the final moments of a presidental election. The reason being that this ballot is so unfair is that the electors for the state of which a citizen is voting in can be easily overturned to a vote for the canidate of which is opposite to what that citizen has elected to vote for.\n",
      "\n",
      "The year of the 2000 campaign, Bush vs. Gore, for the presidency is an excellent example of how this Electoral College is unfair for voters. As Bradford Plumer has addressed in an excerpt of his writing: \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" from\n",
      "\n",
      "Mother Jones , he stated that Al Gore did indeed win the popular vote, but however he lost the presidency because of the quirks of the Electoral College. Also stated by Bradford Plumer is that \"The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example of how the Electoral College is unfair goes back to the 1960 campaign. Again stated by Bradford Plumer, \"The segregationists in the Louisiana legislature had nearly come to success in replacing Democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.\" The state of Louisiana had attempted to do so because the popular vote for Kennedy, would not have actually gone to Kennedy; if they had succeeded in replacing those electors. There is also raise for concern in the event of a tie in a campaign. All 50 states would have only one vote and the selection of the House of Representatives would most likely not reflect the will of the American people. Also, the Senate chooses the vice-president.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an American citizen looking forward to uphold my duty as a responible voter, I ask that we abloish the Electoral College and make the change to deciding among a popular vote. I believe that this change will engage Americans who respectfully choose not to vote to make the choice to vote. It will also give the citizens of America a more fair campaign to vote for when it comes time to vote for a new president. Last but not least, the small percentage of voters who are visiting the ballots for the first time would have a better understanding of how the voting system works. I hope you take this thought into consideration and help make a better voting environment for our citizens of this great country that we call home.\n",

But some students don't have phones, so don't think to hard about this. Students do want to text with their friends, and they can because sometimes school gets boring, but I think that instead of focusing on what to do with the phones, you should focus on what to do with the classes. The reason students text during class is because the class isn't interesting enough. What I noticed is that more people text in the \"boring\" classes then in the \"fun\" classes. You don't need to confiscate the phones, let the students keep them, but if the classes are better, then the rate of students using phones will decrease. Also if the work is to hard, students might text some answers to each other, so don't make the work to hard either. I'm just saying, its your decision. I also use phones, and I love to text, but sometimes play games or text other people when i get bored and sometimes I get texts from my friends asking me what the answers are to a problem or something like that.\n",

When a students cell phone rings in class, it can interrupt the class and it can distract the student and everyone around them. I believe that as long as students get to class in time after lunch, they should be able to use their phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is that lunch can sometimes get boring. Most of the times, the student might not have any friends to talk to while they're downstairs. If most schools use what we use here at SCHOOL_NAME, which is detention, mostly known as \"the bench\" most students would have friends that don't do their homework or might of done something to get them on the bench. Don't you think it would be unfair for a student to be all alone in lunch not having anything to do? Lunch is supposed to be a free time where we can have fun, instead of being bored in class like it shows in the video, but right now it feels like its just another class period. Students don't get to use their phones, and they're being supervised.\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as phones are being turned off by the time they're in class, students should be able to use them. Although a student might have a class after lunch, snack or any other free period, using a phone can let them concentrate more. It lets them concentrate more in the perspective that a student might want to use their phone badly during class. Instead of taking the phone out and using it in a sneaky way, like it shows in the video, they can just take it out in their free time and pay more attention during class. Not giving a student the ability to use their phones, might increase the chance of a students grade getting lower, or them getting their phones taken away. I'm sure any principal would prefer to get their students grade to be high and to be enthusiastic about going to school. Also as you can see in the video, some students would just stay outside of school, which makes them be late, just to talk on the phone. When staying out is not an option, they might also just stay in their locker and miss some time in the class just to be on the phone.\n",

      "Giving something new a try, can help you see if it would succeed or if it just simply has to be taken away. Trying using the phones during lunch and other free periods at least for a month, can make you see if its worth it or if its just not possible. If it shows a lot of distraction in getting back to class or on point then you can take it away permanently or for a few days.\n",

      "I think that the first policy apply because people use there cell phones for mor than just goofing off. They can be used as a thing to tell some on I'm sick pick me up please, or if an emergency pops up so these are the reasons why.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, what if a student was sick or had a condition that was very embarrassing to them if they had there cell phones they could call or text during the free time and be less embarrassed, where as if they couldn't they would have to ask to go to the teacher and ask to go to the office.\n",

Its not hurting anybody as long as the phone is turned off and doesn't cause a distraction during class time then why would it be a problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that some teenagers will still try to text during class but the number of people who do will go down. The school should treat students and teachers fairly. If there trying to be fair then the teachers shouldn't be aloud to use there cell phones during class either. Cell phones aren't even that bad in the first place. Yes, most of Americans use them to much, and they are a huge distraction most of the time but they still haven't done any harm to the American society. Actually cell phones have actually brought a lot of people closer together. They also serve the purpose to help people out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand there's not that great of a purpose to having a cell phone at school, but it would make the student body a whole lot happier than it is today. Just the short time we have during class would just be so much better for everybody in the entire school. I still don't even understand why we aren't aloud to use them during class. Why do the teachers care, there getting paid? If a student doesn't want to listen then they shouldn't be forced too. Kids go to school to get a education i understand it shouldn't be interrupted by cell phones. but kids need to have a good time well learning. School is a place for education but come on at least let kids have some socialization.\n",

      "As a student of SCHOOL_NAME, I personally believe that phones should not be allowed at school for three main reasons. Safety, distraction , and responsibility is the main purpose and there are three reasons into what i have to say. Being in middle school is a experience all students would like to remember. Having cell phones on school property is something I am sure all parents worry about .\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety is the number one goal , when SCHOOL_NAME\n",
      "\n",
      "was built back in 2009 , I believe. By having cell phones it takes a toll on a lot of our students. For example , PROPER_NAME is in the eight grade and there is a new girl that just moved to Texas and goes to RELATIVE_NAME school. Well, RELATIVE_NAME and her boyfriend broke up , because now he like the new girl , OTHER_NAME. Since RELATIVE_NAME is so popular at her school during class one day she takes her phone out , while they are taking a test and texts all of her little groupie's. Well little does OTHER_NAME know but they all are going to gang up on her at the restrooms. This all occurred through a text message which cause so much to occur at any time .\n",
      "\n",
      "Distractions are another event that happens when schools allows students to have cellular devices. Instead of paying attention in class , 75% of the students are focused on texting other fellow students. Well one day when threes a big text mainly half of the class has failed the test due to having a distraction , considered as a cell phone . But little does the teacher know that they all failed because they had their phones out causing them to stay off task and have more fun texting and whatever else they cell phones carry .\n",
      "\n",
      "Responsibility , is something kids should start doing entering middle school, being responsible about everything. Having a cell phone on school grounds is a big one. Once of school grounds its no longer the schools problem if stolen its yours. Your phone could $800 dollars alone , if stolen or lost at school , its your responsibility in order to find what you lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as a eight grader and the experiences I have had in my past , I truly think all electronic devices can be brought to school , but kept off during all hours of your teaching and learning. Also if your bringing them to school on a daily basis it is your responsibility to keep up with what you bring with you at all times. Like our school quote say, \"Except Excellence In Everything \".\n",

A lot or students may agree with this policy just b. cause it have has 2 involve cells phones and we just want 2 use them cells phone are good in some ways 2 bring them 2 school and in other ways they are not every body has there own opinion.\n",

      "If not following the rules. Another reason i think we should have our cell phone during lunch & free time is because after we eat out lunch we don't have anything to do just sit around & talk to our friends. Like in our core classes after we finish our work and the teacher had nothing for us to do, then we should be able to have our cell phones out during that time too it would be fair.

      "Hi. My name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME and I am part of the Student Body Council. I have a strong opinion on the two policies that you have asked the Student Body Council to deliberate on and give you our opinions. I believe that Policy 1, Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the best choice. Now let me tell you why.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, if you choose Policy 2, Do not allow students to have phones at school at all, is the worst option, I believe. I have done research and according to Psychologist OTHER_NAME, ninety percent of schools that do not allow phones at school have unhappy children which eventually affects their behavior and their attitude toward other kids, teachers, and administrators.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a student has to go to after school because he has to make up a test, that student would have to call his parents. If you do not allow phones at school he cannot call his parents which can eventually result in him getting grounded because his parents didn't know that he had to stay after school and were extremely worried about him. It could also result in him walking home which is a huge risk because he could get hit by a car or kidnapped.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with Policy 1 because if students abide by that policy than there would be no reason to take the phones away. Of course if a student doesn't abide by the policy, he or she should get his or her phone taken away and his or her parents would have to pick it up from the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you listen to my opinion about this matter because it is not fair if we don't get to use the right to use our phones, when we already have that right. Please listen, think, and discuss with other students about what policy they think should be enforced.\n",

      "I am writing you a letter to describe to you i think the better policy, policy 2 one reason is because, phones are not allowed in the school in the first place, phones are a disturbing materials for class and its better to not have phones in school at all. Even though school allows them to have phones students will still turn them on and use them during class. Also some students use phone during reading time when they are in the library when supposable the teacher is teaching them and behind her back many kids are texting with their phones . Another occasions kids usually need to be doing their work but they are instead texting. i believe policy 2 is better for the school not to allow students have phones at school at all. if you have any questions please contact me as soon as you can at PHONE_NUMBER\n",

      "Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Although I realize that Policy 2 has some benefits of its own I ask you to strongly consider Policy 1. Policy 1 you would only approve if you knew that you could trust us. So if you don't not approve that plan are you saying that you don't trust the kids at your school. That would only reflect badly upon you.\n",
      "\n",
      "My second reason that you should allow kids to have phones at school would be because children should be learning by now that they should know when and when not it is appropriate to use cell phones. Allowing them never to learn this skill will only result in a future problem of our generation getting fired because they do not know when it is appropriate to take out there cell phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "My third and final reason is that some parents after school forget to pick up there kids so the child needs some way of reaching them so that they are not forgotten. After all no school wants kids roaming around it 3 hours after school has ended because some parent forgot to pick up there kids.\n",
      "\n",

      "Of the new policy of cell phone, students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, and to be also used only on free time periods like lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason why students should bring their cell phones is because students can use them for emergencies and other uses like calling their parents to pick them up after school. If phones are used in class, they may get a warning or be taken away by the teacher. When taken by the teacher, they may receive their phone after the class period.\n",
      "\n",
      "When an emergency happens, Students can call their parents or call for help when they are instructed to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling their parents can let them know that they are all safe from a natural disaster. Either it is a flood, earthquake, tornado, etc. Students letting their parents know that they are fine shows the responsibility they carry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling parents after school can let them know what time their child gets out of school. When not having a cell phone, certain students have to use the phones in class and/or the ones in the office. If so, they may or may not be able to get out of school on time. Parents always have to make sure they leave on time to know what happens at school and after school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having parents to know that their child is doing good in school means that their parents are happy that their child had a grea\n",
      "\n",
      "The last reason why phones should be brought to school is because that students should enjoy a nice school year. Having a great school year for students means that they can memorize all the times they had for the year. Letting them know they had fun is that it leaves them with a happy day. It can make kids happy for themselves and the people around them. Also it makes friends closer with one another when they talk about their day.\n",

      "Everyday cell phones save the lives of people. I believe that cell phones are a great piece of technology that we all use in our everyday lives. To me allowing students to bring their phones to school and use them during their free periods is a great idea, As long as the students turn them off while in classes. Phones serve a great variety of helpful communication in our lives. An example of this policy to allow phones in free periods would be such as if a student forgot their homework they might be able to call or text someone to come drop it off for them so their grades do not suffer. Also it would make people less shy and more communicative.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the students agree to this policy of turning phones off turning class time so they are not distracted, there is no way that the phones can cause any harm or distraction to the students. However, if a student is caught with a cell phone on in class or using a cell phone, the punishment should result in a detention and suspension of the phone for the rest of the day. The student could return at the end of the day to receive their phone and detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phones help everyone communicate better. With a phone people can easily talk with just a press of a button. Phones in school during free periods would make communication between students much easier and the life of the school much happier. Also if students were allowed to use phones at school, many students would go out and buy new phones which would only help our economy today in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many students grades drop because of their silliness of forgetting homework and projects somewhere. With a phone in school and being allowed to use your cell phone during a free period many students would be able to get their homework or projects etc. dropped off so they could still get full credit on the assignment. Allowing cell phones in school would increase grade averages in the school which would be very good for the schools reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Allowing the policy of cell phones in school during free periods could only help our schools and economy. To not accept this policy would just be an unintelligent mistake.

      "How many times a day do you think you send a text message? Think about that then think about the messages that you sent that actually matter. In my opinion I think students should be able to use their cell phones during lunch or free time because it could be an emergency. and you might throw that statement against me by saying that it's nothing the school can't handle but it could very well be a private matter the student is embarrassed about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes students are scared of sharing private things with adults in school thus they have a cell phone to contact a parent of legal guardian to help them with whatever has gone wrong. My point isn't that every time you pick up your cell phone to contact an adult it means it's an emergency; my point is that everyone deserves their privacy without an adult at school's help.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand and am fully aware that students may abuse these privileges for their own entertainment and pleasure however adults are still in charge and have every right to rid the student of their cell phone. Personally I don't care about using my cell phone in school unless it's a rare occasion in which I would like to contact a parent. I do not need to text my friends while I am at school because I know I will see them later and they're probably in the next classroom over anyways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason why I would want to have a cell phone privilege during lunch and/or free time is because of transportation purposes. For example, my sister recently got her drivers licence and now drives me to school every morning but I am never sure if she will be there to pick me up after school. Or even if a student has an appointment and it got canceled they would needed to contact a parent. Here at SCHOOL_NAME\n",

      "\n",
      "If we couldn't bring our cell phones to school, we wouldn't be able to call our parents if a sports practice is done or cancelled from bad weather, or you missed the bus, or you had to stay after for a test or gym make-ups. I know what your thinking we could just use the school phones, but it takes so long to do that, it's so much easier to text or call someone to pick you up, because you have their number in your phone if you don't know it and instead have to spend a couple minutes trying to find their number.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we should have them because you could communicate with friends at lunch or other free times, instead of asking if you could go look for them if you had to ask them something. Honestly, if our school did have the rule that we could have our cell phones out at lunch or free times and not in classes, everyone I know would want that, but so many kids would be texting during class and not paying attention. Even if you had the rule that we couldn't even bring them to school, how many people do you think would listen? I would probably bring mine out of habit, for if I have practices or if I stayed after school, but I never text or have my phone in class or even on for that matter. But people would text even more and have their cell phones out way more if we had that rule at school. It would be chaos, kids getting in trouble day after day because of their cell phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way kids are probably going to still have their phones out and using them. But, I bet if you surveyed the entire school, pretty much everyone would say they wanted to be able to have their phones out, instead of hiding them like they usually do during class. And who knows, the kids at our school might even listen if we were able to have our phones, because they think it's pointless to go against the rules, when they could just wait until after class, during passing time to use them, it could happen........ just not a very high chance of it happening. So, all in all, I think we should be able to have our phones out when we don't have classes, because kids are going to have them out either way, and it would be the easier choice, on everyone, to make, and kids wouldn't get into trouble on a daily basis. And policy one would just be the better decision.\n",

      "Imagine walking into a classroom where as soon as the teacher turns to the white board the students pull out phones and other devices and begin using them. Because they are allowed to have phones during free times they can't get into as much trouble for having such things on. Have you ever tried talking to someone who is texting and they don't even respond?\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite many pleas about how it would cut down on texts during class, I believe the no phones at all during school to make much more sense. The no phones condition would make the school not responsible for any stolen phones, stop almost all texting during class and make test scores higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our school I have sometimes seen problems where kids will steal each others stuff including phones, if the teachers or kids don't know who stole it or can't get it back the I can see many an angered parent suing the district or the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know for a fact that I have once suffered as I thought someone had stolen my phone and I wouldn't get it back, I knew that if I would tell a teacher the whole class would be punished until someone came forward and even then my parents would be mad unless that person would get suspended or expelled. I know that in the district handbook said it wouldn't be responsible for any lost items but if you allow kids to bring electronics to school you are making yourself responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would also cut down on texting during class as if children are caught with a phone even in their pocket they would be in trouble. Once before in Spanish class I was caught texting but it was only because the phone was in my hand that my teacher could prove it, had I slipped the phone into my backpack as I saw her coming she would have no reason to think that I had been texting in her class beside vague suspicion. Another thing it would do is if a teacher heard a phone ring in class they used to go easy on people because their only fault might have been forgetting to turn it off. With this new policy in place kids could be punished just for having it there not just on.\n",

      "Another good thing no phones would do would to make test scores higher. Without as much distraction caused by drama such as how 'PROPER_NAME and PROPER_NAME are dating' or 'how cute is so-and-so' they would be able to focus more in class, learn more and test better. The other thing is kids wouldn't have it as easy if they wanted to cheat on tests and therefore make their tests invalid. For any school that strives to make itself better a 'No Phone' policy would help them a lot.\n",

A couple of reasons i think it is a good idea is because if we are not in class then what is the point. Around campus i see kids using there phones anyways, most students don't even listen to the rules about no cell phone at school. And another thing what if there is an emergency at home and your parents need to get a hold of you. Most kids text at lunch so u should just allow it.\n",

In this article I am going to explain to you about why our principal should consider the policy that allows students in our school to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as phones are turned off during class time. I think that we should be able to have phones in school for our free time. We barely get enough time in school for anything as it is. We get up in the morning, go to school, and attend class periods all day for 8 hours strait and then end up going home with homework in your hands. Then we get up the next morning and do as we did the day before all over again. How much does a school expect one student to handle. i don't think the principal should even have a right to allow the policy that does not allow students to use cell phones in school at all. I know that education is very important and that students should do as well as we can and get good grades. But having the right to use a cell phone during lunch period or any other free time would not affect that at all. The principal should definitely consider the policy that allows students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and any other free time, as long as they are turned off during class.\n",

What if you have a family emergency that you don't hear about because you don't have you phone during lunch and free times. I think that we would all think the same thing as to why we need our cell phones because you might want to talk to your friends after school to find out where you are going to hang out and wouldn't be able to because you don't have your phone. if you need to know where to go after school and you wouldn't have a phone to talk to your mom or dad to find out where to go. when we are not able to contact our family we wont want to come to this school and would maybe switch schools because there is SCHOOL_NAME, SCHOOL_NAME, and SCHOOL_NAME\n",

Other students might be texting their friends who are in class while they have a free period.\n",

      "If you remained with policy two more students would be tempted to use their phones during school hours and not just their own free time. My school has a policy that states that you may have your phones out after the school bell rings that states school is out. Also after that bell has rang, you many have it out on the bus if it's not a distraction for other people. Most students in my school think its a good rule, but most of them break it and have their phones with them during school hours anyway. If the teacher hears the phone, they will take the phone and send it to the office. It will remain there until a parent or guardian comes for it, and that student who had the phone would be sent to SMC, Student Management Center. So in the end Policy one would be the better choice to go with.\n",

If someone doesn't want to talk to the other person when they are in the area, phones may make the other person do what they want which leads to bad things happening. Also, they are distracting to the teachers that are monitoring the lunch because the student is constantly looking down at the phone and pressing buttons. This could mean that they are cheating on homework, or just messing around. This is not good because the teachers need the school to be safe, and phones are very distracting to other students. Some students don't want to look over and notice their friend is laughing about something on their phone.\n",

You would use the phones in the main office and if that isn't working, then use your teacher's phone. There are also tools on the cell phones like calculators, and other things. You don't need this in the classroom because the teacher could suspect that you are cheating or doing something else. When there is an event where you have to take a picture, the teacher should allow the students to bring in a disposable camera, not a cell phone. Cell phones may be traded around the room, and the students could lose their phone.\n",

If you don't let us bring cell phones well don't let the teachers using them in class, because if we can't bring them well that's not fair to us. Will you please let us bring cell phones if somebody gets caught three times with a cell phone please don't let them bring them again, don't charge them.

Also, this would help students grades because in many classes they are assigned group projects. If a student needs to find members of their group, and they cant find them, their grades might fall due to their incomplete project, this might make our school and teachers look bad compared to other schools.

      "\n",
      "But I agree that we should not be allowed cell phones in class. When you are in a class room it is the teachers job to make sure you learn. Not to text or be on the phone with someone. But it is very hard to not be able to use you phone almost all day. We have breaks in school like lunch and advisory. I think we should be allowed to use them then. Lunch you are eating and talking to friends and sometimes you run out of subjects to talk about. So you could use your phone and text one of your friends from another school or a family member. It could be distracting during advisory because advisory is time to go see teachers if you have to retake a test, make up missing assignments and to get some of your homework done.\n",

      "My opinion is that student's shouldn't be allowed to have phones in school because it disrupts the learning process of other people. A lot of kids have phones because their parent's want to know if they are okay and safe but if they are in school they will be safe because it's the school's responsibility and that's why they have camera's and security guards, and if their not in school the school calls the parent's to ask why their son or daughter didn't go to school , and the parent's will know if their son or daughter showed up to school or ditched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also instead of talking on the phone at lunch they can be hanging out with their friends or studying for a test . Sometimes kids forget to turn off their phone and it rings in the middle of the class it disrupts the kids around them. And it stops the teacher from teaching because she has to take the phone away and give the consequences . It is disturbing because everyone stops learning because a kid forgot to turn of his phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "School is made to learn not to talk at lunch and text during class. It also stop the learning process of themselves because they are more concerned about getting a call at lunch or a text message that they wont pay attention to their studies and when a test comes they won't know what to answer because they weren't paying attention. For example let's say a girl named PROPER_NAME was on too busy on the phone and didn't study for her test the next day, She will copy the person sitting next to her , and what if that person is guessing on all the questions ? PROPER_NAME and her neighbor both failed that test.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also think it's unfair because some kids spend all their time studying for a test and a person ,who didn't even bother to open their book to study, is going to copy them. I think everyone's opinion count's and noone should be left unheard because one change can make a world difference\n",

Many times, the teachers here do not let students use the school phone so they have no way of contacting their parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that the staff must be frustrated with all the texting during class and I will admit that sometimes cell phone rings disrupt the class. I think this happens because the students are not allowed to have cell phones during times that they are not in class so they find their own way to use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banning cell phones from school would be very unfair to those who always follow the rules and deserve the cell phone use. Many teachers respond to that with, \"Well one bad apple ruins whole bunch,\" and that is not necessarily fair. We are a new generation and old sayings such as that one might be ready for an upgrade. Even if cell phones were banned, though, students would still carry them to and from school. I believe that is because students who get detentions regularly don't care if they get a few more for the sake of their cell phones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason for policy one is that Henry is a community middle school and even though the emphasis is on \"school\" for me, for others the emphasis is on \"community\" so having the freedom to have phones during passing periods and lunch might help keep some students more focused during class. Isn't that what all teachers want? The more focused they are, the more likely they are to pull up their grades and go to college and end up with a life full of success.\n",

      "Even though it doesn't seem likely that cell phones could possibly change a good chunk of the student body, they can. The more freedom we, being the students, are granted, the more we are going to compromise with the teachers and try harder during class. So I truly believe that cell phone use during times that we are not in class would be a better choice that to not be able to have them at all.

Of course they over used it and cheated on homework and the where getting on the internet and looking up bad things and more kids were becoming bad. The teachers were just done dealing with all the kids who were cheating on test and texting in class. I also think that if we could bring our phones to class that it would be good for some kids because then we could text our parents and tell them we need lunch money, homework, backpacks, and anything we left at home.

Would you not think that if a school yard bully got his hands on a cell-phone that he/she would try to pass his or her aggression on by using a text or phone call? Cyber bulling is dangerous and should not be taken lightly. I am not saying that Cyber bulling will happen but there is just to big of a risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason of mine that I think that Policy 2 would be the best choice is that cell-phones will be constantly getting lost or stolen. Not every family wants their child to have a cell-phone. And if they don't have one there going to look at every one else and get jealous. Also cell-pones now a days are small. If they fall out of your pocket or book bag it could take a long time for it to reaper. You'd have to file the report and it would be oh so time consuming. There should be no cell-phones in school because they are easy to lose and easy to get stolen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third reason why we should have Policy 2 is because they are to much of a distraction. I would love just to whip my cell-phone every time I wanted to call one of my friends, but that is to distracting. We come to school every day to get an education; not to talk with friends. Students grades would start to suffer because they couldn't stop thinking about what there peers are doing. So cell-phones are a distraction and that is why they should not be in school.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have showed you my three reasons why we should follow Policy 2. They will lead to a rise of Cyber bulling, would be constantly getting lost or stolen, and are a distraction.\n",

      "I, a student of your school SCHOOL_NAME, advise you enforce policy 1. I believe this because lunch is supposed to be a free time where students can take a break from school work in order to be able to work for the rest of the day. Though sneaking cell phones in classrooms are an issue in this option. However, I have made a plan to prevent this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Teachers can make students turn on alarms on their cell phones throughout the day so teachers can detect cell phones being on. You would also have to make them turn their cell phones to the maximum volume so teachers can hear if the students are turning them down. There is an issue of students turning off their cell phone alarms during free times, but teachers can check their cell phones after free times.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also another problem with students turning off the alarms during class, though there is a solution to that also. Teachers can patrol the classroom while teaching orally. They can also get a chalkboard with wheels and patrol while teaching with a chalkboard. Teachers will be able to see their cell phones being used.\n",
      "\n",

      "Hello I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME the school that you are the principle of. I would like to persuade you to not allow phones at school for three reasons. One they will distract students and they will not be able to do the work that is given to them. Second they will use there phones at school to call there parents to get them because they do not want to be at school. Last, teacher will find that students are no longer paying attention to them and pull out there own cell phone and use it to call friends and family. So those are the reasons that I think that students should not be aloud to bring their phones to school.\n",
      "\n",
      "First the students will like this new policy that allows cell phones at school and I think that this is a bad idea. the students will be in class and texting other student in different classes or even in the same class. They will not be able to concentrate on what they are doing if they are texting there friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second they will try to call their parents to come and pick them up. kids do not want to be at school so there is no way that people will not try to get their parents to get them. Students do not want to be studying the Greeks they rather be playing video games and do other thing at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third teacher will want to pull their phone out and text and call friends and family. Then no one is being taught any thing and no one will learn. people will not care about school any more and just stay home.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if there is any choices that you would take I would advise this one. this is the best choice because students will be distracted, they will call their parents to come and get them, and lastly teachers will start texting in class.\n",

      "I think that cell phones during school should be aloud but only during free periods. So i support policy 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy is considerable and is much more fair to students then policy 2 because you would at least allow students to bring in cell phones and use them during appropriate times in the day regardless to just cutting them off completely. So as a student i think we should be remotely thankful for the 1st policy to even be an option because of the way we tortured our privileges using them in school.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you didn't bring this out to the public and made the decision on your own to just stick with policy 2 then there would be some problems with the students because this similar situation happened at SCHOOL_NAME and the students there ended up protesting because they wanted a say in what they should be able to do. So i like the way you are being fair and letting us tell you how we think it should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy 1 is the better selection anyway because this way you keep your students happier and i don't see a problem on letting kids use there cell phones during free periods/lunch periods because these wont completely distract them during a period like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ended up choosing policy 2 don't think students would kick back and just listen to that rule. I guarantee students would end up still bringing there cell phones to school and using them when their not supposed to. If they where aloud like in policy 1 then students wouldn't try as much to sneak them in because they know that they'll be able to use/check them at some point in the day.\n",
      "\n",

Personally I feel that we (the students) should be allowed to carry our cell phones around and to school if we use them wisely. We should be allowed to use them during passing breaks and at lunch because that will and does not affect our learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see why this rule was so strictly enforced as well because some students could abuse this and bring their phones into class. Just having it in class wouldn't be that bad either but some students may try and use them. Which is why i think the rule of having phones be turned off while in class is the perfect solution. But if the students ever try to abuse that ability of having it with them, then the teachers just need to put their foot down and maybe even give punishments to the students who don't choose to follow their rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some kids only got their cell phones so that their parents could contact them when needed. If students weren't allowed to have their phones then the parents may not be able to reach them when needed.

Our parents would be happy with this because then we could tell them what they needed or just answer back.\n",

      "the free time to text and talk on the phone during lunch and every other free time then you would have less people getting in trouble and less problems. Being a student and a teenager i love to text and talk to my friends and since i don't see them all i really enjoy having the time to talk to them when i can. This policy would create a down spiral of texting in class and having people getting in trouble because of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand how some people would say that this will make more chaos, yet i do believe that the kids in the school would not do anything to jeopardise this ability. I speak for all of my peers when i say this. If you wanted to just try it out that would be better than not trying anything at all. The teachers will most likely have better grades in their grade book because the students are paying attention a little better now that they know in less than an hour they will be able to text their friends without any hassle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also i think you shouldn't let the phones come in the class or if they do put them at the back so the kids can grab it and go and text as they walk to the next class. If you see a problem to this policy then of course you may go ahead and band cellular devices from the school. I suggest you don't do that because then the kids will bring them anyways and get in trouble more and that would be a bad thing in your case. Whatever you decide the kids will have to listen, but my decision would be to let us kids text and get it done with before we go to class. The students would appreciate you trying to understand their wants even more than you have to and you would have the possibility to be loved forever in these halls.\n",

      "I also suggest that if one grade can't handle then don't punish the other grades because of one mistake in another grade. I speak for all of SCHOOL_NAME when i say we would love to be able to text at certain points and we would try our best to pay more attention to the classes. I do believe that what i am saying may be the best choice to at least try. It may not turn out how I thought it would but at least the students would know that you tried something new but we were the ones who messed it up. If this choice does not work then no phones at school would be acceptable because we, the students, were the ones who couldn't mature enough to handle that big responsibility that you gave us.\n",

I do believe that education matters and that it is disrespectful when certain people interrupt other students will to learn with distracting actions and behaviors, we are here to learn and I want to learn, but I also believe that we as students should have a few privileges and using cell phones at an appropriate time is one of them.\n",

In that case people lives are at risk and just 1 student with a cell phone can be a good thing for once. I believe in the part when student can not use them in class because class is a place for learning not socializing with people through text messages. At most schools at lease 85% of student have a cell phone in their pocket,locker,or backpack. At my school it is like phones are illegal here.

      "First of all i believe that with cell phones at lunch or break would prevent students from being tempted to take them out in class. With there phones out during there free time they will students could be more social with other students teaching them a valuable life lesson. Because students will be able to use them during free time, they will feel as though they do not have to use them during class time. Saving both the teacher and the students some trouble.\n",

      "With all of the noise gone from the lunchroom or break area teachers could get more done with the day then waiting around looking to get people into trouble. Lastly of this idea every day i see teachers complaining that, a students phone went off in class, well if we could use them during free time maybe that wouldn't happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, i will say that with cell phones there could also be better working conditions for teachers as well as students. With cell phones, teacher would be able to use that as a work device they could save time, they could be used to call an important person or a speaker to talk to there class, and teachers will be able to do work that would be unavailable to them on a computer .\n",

Also it my be a emergency's i say this because probably your mother sick or your father or grandparents in the hospital and they had a heart attack.

      "If we get this policy we should be able to show our principal that we are young adults. If we have this policy i am going to be happy cause this a change to show our principal that we can do it without her telling us because we are older to know what's right from wrong. That's a good idea to do because what if something goes wrong and you need your mom ,you can always call her at lunch if you need her. If u need some advice and you don't want to go to your principal u should be able to call your mom at lunch. That's all I have to say bye.\n",

      "The ability to have cell phones on school campus is not the best idea. Kids can cheat on tests without the teachers knowing. Sometimes teachers trust the students that they wont text in class, but kids can break that rule. Yes, sometimes it is nice to have your cell phone out for a calculator (if you are allowed to use one) or even to call your parents if there is a big emergency happening at the school, but kids ruin the advantage that they get for being able to have their cell phones out.\n",

      "Since I a' m a student at a SCHOOL_NAME, i think it will be awesome to be able to have your phones out during break times. The only thing wrong with that is kids will have their cell phones on in classes and text when they are not supposed to. If i was sitting next to a student that texts non stop during class time, it would be very annoying. So not only is it rude for students to text while their teacher is speaking, but also can be disturbing to students around the person that's texts while they are trying to do class work.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Cell phones can actually help sometimes. For example, if a student saw something that is not suppose to be happening, they can just make an emergency call and do a lot of help. I can see reasons why students are not allowed to bring their cell phones, but if they do teachers can just get them into trouble and they wont do that anymore. If they will then that's when you don't let them bring it to school at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some students need a cell phone because they need to make a call right after school, and I did see people be in that kind of situation. They could be home alone and they need some to pick them up. There are many more reasons of how the cell phone is help full foe the students in SCHOOL_NAME.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also many reasons of why you should make it be in the policy number two. Some students are scared to get caught with their cell phones because they know that they are going to be in trouble at home. Some don't care and they do some students get caught with using a cell phone, and when the teacher tells them to give it to me they just don't listen and then they get in a lot of trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see how there could be arguments but I still think it would be better if we would go with the policy number one. Yes i see how it could be a problem but still many students will have their cell phones of during class time. But i know that a lot of our students wont listen to policy number two and that will get them mad and for sure they wont follow that rule. Also students that wont listen to policy number one still will get in trouble. So i thin that policy number one is better.\n",

      "Distance learning is a program that allows students to take classes at home rather than school. I believe that this is a very beneficial resource to the average student. Distance learning is beneficial to absents students, students struggling with mental health, and students struggling with specific classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distance learning would help students that have to absent due to family issues, a doctor's appointment, etc. If they had the ability to take the class online, then they would not be behind other students in the class. It would also maintain the speed of the class rather than having to slow down at certain points to explain concepts that the absent student had missed. For example, I was absent from a math class on Thursday, so I used an online tool that the teacher provided to take notes and learn what was taught in class that day. This benefited me so I could continue taking notes from where the entire class left off. However, when I missed a day in my history class, I was not able to get the notes and I did not know what was going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "This form of learning would also be beneficial to students struggling with mental health issues. If they had the opportunity to finish their work online, then they could avoid some triggers at school as well as bullies. Sometimes students may avoid going to school because of their current mental state. For instance, my friend, PROPER_NAME, struggled with depression and anxiety, so she ended up missing a lot of school. This caused her to fail most of her classes. She was bullied a lot and online classes would've helped her avoid those people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another benefit to the availability of online classes is extra help for students that struggle with a particular area of school. For example, If I was failing Calculus, then I could just watch the lectures from the online classes and complete some of the practices to help me learn the concepts. It would prepare me for classwork, quizzes, and tests that I would have flunked otherwise. Also, it doesn't require staying after school, so students wouldn't have to find a ride or worry about when the teacher is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absent students would be able to stay on top of their work with distance learning. Students struggling with mental health could also work and avoid mean people. Also, students struggling in a class could receive more help with areas they are not doing well on. Distance based learning would be very beneficial and I support it.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If students are able to attend to classes from home by way on online or video conferencing it is a good choice, because students can have more time to spend with your family, students are able to do other such of things while they are doing something, and also students can travel to different places.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some students when they have classes by online they save more time for them and for their family. For example, my sister PROPER_NAME was going to normal classes at school but she did not want to go to school anymore so she decided to attend to classes by online, when she was taking her classes by online she noticed that she had more time to spend with her family, because when she was going to school she never had the chance to spend time with her parents like she does now like; by going shopping, visiting other families, etc. now she can go with her parents and do fun stuffs. Sometimes she also have the chance to go to parties with her friends, but before going out somewhere she always needed to finish her work and take her classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, some schools offer distance learning to attend to classes by way of online. Students are able to do other such of things while they are doing something. For example, my cousin PROPER_NAME is taking classes online because she needed to take care of her one kid at home, one day her family and she were talking in a group chat that they wanted to do something for Christmas that was coming up in a week so all her family wanted to pass Christmas at her house so she also agreed with that and she needed to clean and be ready for that Christmas but while she was preparing all that she was preparing the food, the Christmas tree, drinks, table and making sure that all the gifts were able to fit under and around the Christmas tree, so she was not so worried about her classes online, because she was able to do both things at the same time; preparing the Christmas stuffs and taking her classes online, and also she was very comfortable doing both things because it was not complicated for her and she toke it as the easy way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last, learning from attending to classes by online is a good choice. Some students when they are taking their classes online they can also travel to different places. For example, when my cousin PROPER_NAME and me went to Myrtle Beach, I asked to my cousin Verenice why did she bring her computer to the beach and then she told me that she was going to need it because she was taking some classes by online, but I was wondering if she can take her classes while she was not at home, then I asked her and she told me that she was able to take her computer anywhere she was going and she can still take her classes online as normally, so that really surprised me because I did not know that students that take classes online could also have the chance to take their classes by being in different place, she was just relaxing the whole day and was enjoying every single moment without any interruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Conclusion, I agree that students can attend to online classes because it can help them a lot and they can also save more time than going to normal classes. It is a good choice for students to learn and attend to classes from online or video conferencing, because students are able to spend more time with their family, they are able to other things while they are doing something else, and also students have the chance to travel to different places with having no problems with it.\n",

      "it has my attention that are school should have online classes and it could benefit us and everyone that dose't go to school any more. If there is a bad storm maybe they drop out and they don't have time any more should have online class for the extra help and it could be a step to a better future.\n",
      "\n",
      "My reason are the long snow days and other weather problem online class it could give us the chance to take are time and not be rush by other people on online class.It could help student that don't have time for school any more because of work or they got a problem being at school. Maybe a student has to go out of town be of a family emergency but they don't want to get left be hind of the other people in class. They can do online work while they are way they could also ask there teachers for help online and do a video conference and it would be good because the student is getting a one on one lesson and can befit them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people need this if there miss a class credit and they need before graduation it can help them. If they have a full schedule on the school day they can take it online so they can catch up and make it on time for graduation. a lot of people might what to finish school but they don't have the time any more online classes could help balance there schedule. many people want to take a class for the hack of it for a extra credit for maybe an advance diploma or if they just want to get out school faster and graduate. A lot of people would have a lot of time or not a lot of time because of work online class would be helpful for a lot of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Online class is the step to good education it could help people get jobs or save money for schools so teachers could have the extra cash for teaching students. Maybe there could be a person that can further are technology and help other people in schools. Online class could get people out of minimum wage and start earning more money. It could also make it a lot easier for people that are home school the information can just be proved online.Online class is a step to a better future and education for people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Online class should be for are school and others so we can get that extra help. For people that don't have time to go or if school is in a bad snow storm so that way its a step to a better future.\n",

      "Generic_Name is an intelligent girl who really enjoys learning, however, going to school is not something she looks forward to. When PROPER_NAME is at school, she is a victim of bullying and it distracts her from her assignments in the classroom. Considering her situation, Generic_Name's parents decided to remove her from the toxic environment of her current school, and enroll her into online courses she can take from home. Many students are in the same situation as Generic_Name, and find going to school hard because of fear of the way their peers treat them. Although public schools provide the social aspect of student's lives, and allow them to communicate and interact with one another, many students would benefit from distance learning because it eliminates bullying, allows students to work at their own pace, and creates a good learning environment for students to better focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "As many people know, bullying is a huge problem plaguing schools all over. It takes place in schools everyday ,and many times goes unnoticed by teachers and staff due to the fact of students concealing their bullying tactics from authority, and making their victim stay silent in fear of being treated worse. These situations make it extremely hard for students to focus in class and complete their work. Bullying also makes students afraid to even go to school, which can cause them to skip and fall behind. Distance school however, gives students the opportunity to work from home, taking online classes or using video conferences to learn material. It helps the many students who experience bullying by eliminating the problem and creating a safe space for learning and creativity to take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, not all students work at the same pace. Many different factors contribute to the way students receive information and the speed at which they complete assignments. Some students just naturally work faster and online classes would allow them to complete school at a quicker pace. Then, there are also the students who work at a much slower pace, and need extra time to process and comprehend information without feeling rushed by their peers. Also, students who are heavy in sports, or already working jobs are often overwhelmed, and online schooling would allow them to create their own schedule based around their activities, while still staying on track and not falling behind. Whatever the situation, the option for students to take part in online school allows them to work at their own individual pace and tailor their curriculum accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, public schools are usually not the most ideal learning environments. Disruptions are frequent and they make it hard for some students to actually be able to focus and complete assignments on time. Also, behavioral problems and fights are common in public schools, and make many students uncomfortable. Furthermore, public schools often lack healthy learning environments and make focusing especially hard for students who have specific learning needs or already have a hard time concentrating. Taking classes in the privacy, and comfort of ones home is a good solution for certain students who struggle with focusing, because the environment is familiar and essentially better suited for learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, many students would benefit from distance school because it eliminates bullying, allows students to work at their own pace, and creates a good learning environment for students to better focus. If more schools offered these programs, bullying rates would decrease, students would have better success in learning, and students would have more excitement when it comes to school instead of stress. All in all, more schools should consider offering online courses to accommodate students, and make school a better, safer, and more successful place for all.\n",

      "Some schools offer the option of attending classes by \"online\" or \"video conferencing\". This may not be a good idea because how does the student going to get responsible? or how can the teachers know if the student is not cheating on a test?. Is there any benefit to know is this option is going to help the student phsychlogy, mentally or physically?. Education is too important! And a better way of learning is by attending to SCHOOL! The way as many people done it. Also, by this way attending to school students might join in sports, activities, etc. It gives more benefits and helps to refresh your mind. School gives classes of \"PE\" which is important because doing sports is healthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2015, a student at Generic_School took the option to attend classes by online because the student was not a \"social\" person which means the student did not like to communicate. But after all the student did regret it. The student noticed that communication is too important because is part of education and how to success in life. The words of the student to advice the students were \" There is no more benefits than attending to school. School does help you to your knowdlegde and prepare you for your future. Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It does affect you plus It does not make sense at all. Why? because WE ARE THE PEOPLE. What I learned by taking this option and what made me regret it was : We are the community, we are the voice of the world and as a group working together we can make big changes and a better society as well. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you \"P.E\" classes and doing sports is wealthy. So by now attending to school is the best option for everyone.\" The student had excellent grades, scholarships, made new friends than he expected to have. Where is he now by making the best option? He is now at SCHOOL_NAME preparing for his major as a lawyer. He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called \"Esol\". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different system's programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school. Going to school has more benefits than you think so you need to fight for it because anything in this life is not easy, but is worth it.\n",

      "Some schools in Virginia are adopt a program that benefit students that can't be in school for some reason. I agree with the idea,this idea consist that students can attend to their classes from home by the way of video conference or online.First, students with health problems are going to be benefit.Second, also students that have responsibilities in their homes, how having a full time job, can finish school with the help of this program.Finally, students that have problem with transport are also benefit with this awesome idea.On the other hand, some patterns said that their children have to be in school and have the same treat than other students and that schools should find another way to help these students.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the idea is going to be a great help for students with health problems.First, when my sister was in school she had problem with her legs and its' was very difficult for her to come to school every day,if this idea was approved four years ago it will help my sister a lot. Second, students with health issues in my school were very happy went their heard about the idea that our school was implemented so, its very difficult for they to come school when their feel bad. Finally, my friend PROPER_NAME is 15 years old he get sick easily his body defense are not like the others people and he was very happy when he heard the notice, he told me \" I can't believe that our school thought on me and the others students with disabilities\" I told him that I was very happy for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students with responsibilities are also benefit.First, they can get a job and finish high school in the same time.Second,they can contribute on the house paying some bills how: pay their own room,bulling their food, or paying water and electricity bills.Finally, they are going to be in school and it is not going to affect them, if they are planning go to college in their future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students that have transport problem also apply. First, some students live to far and is difficult for they come to school and this idea is something that their are considering.Second, some students used Uber to come school and it is very expensive, some of them can't pay 10 to 30 dollars per day.Finally, some patterns are thinking to change their sons for another school that can provide transport to their sons.\n",

      "Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.\n",

      "\n",
      "Most of the time we get distracted at home, for reasons that are not even important at all like we wan to eat, our parents need help and they call us and we need to use the restroom every time and those reasons can be a big issue for people who take classes online.When i was in LOCATION_NAME i took some classes online, it was my first class and my uncle did not know what i was doing classes online and he call me more then 3 times and because i was using my headphones and i did not ear when he call me the 3 times he get mad, he disconnect the computer and the computer shot down, i did not finish the class beacuse of my auncle and the teacher tell me that i was so disrespectfull to her and she didn't wan to give me classes again.\n",

      "The twenty-first century is something different from past generations. Nowadays technology has made it easy to adapt and allowed for a more evolved teaching environment. Although technology is already put into use in most classrooms, a new debate has come forth involving schools allowing students to \"attend\" classes through online or video conferencing. Giving students the opportunity to participate in a class virtually is not beneficial because it will increase cheating, lower motivation and work ethic, and prevent students from forming social skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "The generations in school right now are being taught in a way that has never done before. Every student with access to technology has an abundant amount of information at the edge of their fingertips. This has made students get lazy, and not worry about completing their work because all they have to do is simply type the title of their assigned work and answer sheets will show up. Cheating has been, and will continue to be a big problem in schools all over the country. New soft wares are being developed everyday with the sole purpose of helping students cheat. If a student is taking a class online in the comfort of their own home, they will access those soft wares and have a significantly lower chance of being caught since there is no teacher around. The fact that the class is based online means that students can easily find answers to a quiz or test given to them just by opening a new tab on their browser. There are different techniques used to prevent students from being able to access other browsers while on the virtual classroom but those students are still allowed access to their cellphone. In this generation kids, and teenagers especially are always connected. All of your friends and family are just a button away. If all schools included online school as an option for students, they would be able to use different types of technology not including their computers. If certain measures are taken so different browsers are not accessible during virtual classes, technology like apple watches, tablets, cellphones make it not only make it possible to use the internet, but also give students opportunities to socialize with their friends and share answers in that sense. Virtual classes will raise the amount of cheating done and affect the students negatively.\n",
      "\n",
      "One problem in schools is that after the first semester, or even first quarter, students start experiencing academic burn-outs. Many students dread waking up each morning, but they find the motivation to wake up and attend school because it is on an implemented schedule. Being in a classroom environment helps students strive to be more like the others around them. Students at SCHOOL_NAME were given the option to enroll in semester based online class and more than half the students fell behind. The students progressively got more lazy and stopped finding the time to complete their online classwork. The lack of structure in online classes will negatively affect students since they are no longer forced to show up to class on time to complete their work. A new upcoming study shows that doing schoolwork where relaxation takes place, causes work ethic to decrease. Many students will do the virtual class from the comfort of their bed or couch. Simply being in that environment versus being at a desk and chair, will inevitably cause students to doze off and fall asleep. Distance learning will affect motivation and work ethic in students tremendously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humans are wired to be social, it is what they were born to do. Schools have created an environment where students can socialize and make bonds with the people in their communities. Social skills learned in school are vital to be successful in the future. If students were allowed to do their classes online, it takes away their ability to form those skills. The online classes would isolate the students and negatively impact the way they function in later stages of their life. Kids who are more social have less mental health issues. Being able to go to school and be surrounded with friends and people they know allows students to be happier overall. Staying home and doing your class from there would take that away from kids and the lack of socializing will cause an increase in loneliness. The aspect of personally going into school has shaped the way people will perform in the real world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although some may argue that online school is a better way of learning for them, it is clear that online school will not only cause short term problems, but also long term. If more students were enrolled in online classes performance rates will go down, cheating will be a bigger problem, and students mental health will be negatively impacted. It is time to stop allowing today's generation to rely on technology, and implement things that will prepare them for the real world.\n",

      "\n",

      "To begin with, imagine never going to school again. Most seven hour school days are wasted away due to many interfering factors, so schools should offer online courses for students to prevent wasted time. Although taking online classes will not be beneficial because some classes require a teacher present, schools should offer more online classes because students can get their work done faster, students can work at their own pace, and students can have more time for recreational activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, working at home has many advantages for students because they can get their work done faster than they would in a school environment. School environments can be distracting because of annoying bell rings and loud students, and sometimes it is just best to avoid all distractions and stay at home to do work. Students can work faster because they do not have to wait for the other students in their class to finish their work. Students are more productive because they can move on whenever they feel like they are ready to, accomplishing more. Also, students will not have to drive to school or walk to class saving time that could have been used to get work done. The extra 30 or 40 minutes saved from traveling could be used to do a whole classes work for the day, making taking classes online so much more worthwhile for the student. A home environment helps students stay focused and less distracted because school environments have so much going on it is hard to hone down on school work. Overall, attending classes from home is beneficial to get work done right and fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, another benefit from online school is working on a self created pace. Some students work slower or faster than others and can not succeed properly in a school. For the slower students, they can take the extra time by having long period breaks to rest and to understand the topics to their full extent. And for the fast students, they can advance ahead and potentially complete their classes early in order to either move on to the next subject or move on to college early. Another reason to have online classes is for students that want to have long summer breaks or move on to an occupation if they manage their time right. Since students that work from home can create their own pace to follow, it is beneficial to offer online classes to accommodate every type of student that goes one school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, since students can finish all their work fast, they will have more time for recreational activities to broaden and strengthen their mind outside of class work. The extra time allows for more family bonding. For example, most students do not get home until 4:00pm, and if the student plays a sport, they do not get home until around 6:00pm or 7:00pm. This leaves hardly any time for talking or bonding with their parents, so if online classes are taken by the student, then there will be more time to create a healthy relationship with their parents. Also some families take far, long trips out of the US, causing in school students to get way behind in their classes or even fail them. Thus taking online classes are beneficial to these families to keep their kids educated. Some students already have professions that interfere with school hours. For example, PROPER_NAME is in high school and she is a professional surfer that is constantly traveling abroad for competitions. Her surfing profession has caused her to miss a tremendous amount of school her junior year. The following year, her school offered online classes allowing her to maintain her grades, as well as surf to her best ability. For this reason, schools need to offer online classes to allow students to travel and continue their professions, as well as bond with their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, schools should offer online classes because they can benefit students by allowing them to work faster, allowing them to work at their own pace, and allow them to focus more on their professions or hobbies while still getting educated. A prediction for the future is that students will be overall more productive and schools everywhere will have the technology to accommodate online students. Ask your school if they offer any online classes and apply for them next year for a better, more productive year.\n",

      "Wouldn't it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.\n",

      "Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didn't like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful.

      "My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she could'nt deal with it anymore. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered \"i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now\" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. You can take your classes when ever you are free. If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said \"88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time\". He also said \"only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled\". In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.\n",

      "I don't believe the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First of all, the research showing there is a lot of chance to know about the distance. It's hard to make the online or video to offer the distance. Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasn't focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didn't saw the car she try to cross the road. So,she got some accident because of the video and she just focusing what she is doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most important way is to offer the distance classes from home is using map. It's easy to know how far or how close it is. Other ways, the students have to take care there self when they are in the way because there is a lot of car.\n",

      "Next, she try to cross the way by raining. She didn't pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video. Additional, using map is butter than making online or video. Other ways its hard to make online or video for offer the distance. Most students are not going to focus when there are making that.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, in four year i'll be going to college.When i'm choosing which college to go to, I will ask several people for advice. I'll ask my mom and dad to see how much money we have. Asking them can help me choose college that are not so expensive. Then i'll ask my siblings what they did after high school. One of them is planning to attend SCHOOL_NAME soon, and he told me that is a really good college for studying law. From hearing that, I might add SCHOOL_NAME to my list. Finally I'll ask my counselor where I should go, since she knows what my strength are and what my weakness are. She can suggest which college suits me the best. Hearing those advice from different people can help me choose the best college to attend.\n",

      "After I enrolled in college, I will ask my parents for advice. They told me in college, studying is way more important than socializing. They also warned me to be careful and surround myself with people that will bring positive change in my life. After hearing from them, I asked my friends what they would do. They told me they would party all night and drink alcohol. Comparing my parents advice with my friends, obviously, my parent's advice are much better. It's always better to ask more people than one so you don't make a mistake.\n",

      "Hearing peoples opinions is like being in a talent show and getting judge except it could provide you with great advice. Sometimes seeking multiple opinions can hurt, but they also can help you make a better choice like if your doing something you are not suppose to be doing, their opinions can keep you safe, and it can help you stay on the right track to help you suceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason, is someone elses opinion can keep you from doing things you are not suppose to be doing like smoking, drinking, sneaking out, or even cheating on a test. One time, my older brother PROPER_NAME was asking me if he should sneak out, but before he asked me he asked my uncle Generic_Name and of cource he said no, so then he came to me and said, \"Should I sneak out tonight?\" I told him no, but he did it anyway and didn't come back until my whole family called him and told him to come back home. For him to hear all of our opinions it encouraged him to come back, so because of that he never snuck out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, others opinions can keep you out of harms way. For instance, many middle school kids can easily get persuaded in to doing things that can put them in extreme danger, but as long as you have excelent friends they can make sure you don't get hurt, Now and days kids do not care about their actions, and they don't understand that they are able to get hurt or get others hurt. That's why so many people are dying because the only opinions people care about is how they look, or how nice their clothes are meanwhile we have people that are doing stupid things and are in danger because no one really cares what others do. Everyone can always get persuaded into doing things, yet still can't get influenced to pick their life over harmful substances or choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, your oinions can help others like your family members stay on the right path in life. For example, my mom was hanging out with the wrong group of people, so they made her try different things she never did before, and because of that she chose the wrong life style to live and it had her going in and out of jail. Since she had four kids we kind of pushed her to get her life, and decisions on the right track and it helped her. Everytime we saw her all of my siblings would give their opinions, she may have not liked what we said, but she knew it was to help her get her life together.\n",
